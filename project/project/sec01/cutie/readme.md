<li> <b>Requirement Gathering : </b><br>
Our team conducted meetings with our stakeholders to understand their requirements and expectations from the Attendance System. All of the requirements we gathered, including functionality, user roles, and system constraints are documented.

<li><b>System Design : </b><br>
Our team had collaborated with our stakeholders to create a system design that aligned with their requirements. We had defined the system architecture, including the backend, database, and user interface components. We had also created high-level and detailed design documentation, specifying the system’s modules, their interactions, and data flow.

1.1	Low Fidelity UI:
In the earlier stages of development, The UI module utilizes low fidelity designs. These designs are basic wireframes or sketches that outline the structure, layout and flow of the user interface. The wireframes are sketched on sticky notes so that it can be rearranged on a board or a wall.
![17](https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/assets/129287788/263d97b5-c67c-48e7-a733-0ca869d02932)

1.2	High Fidelity UI:
In later stages of development, the UI module transitions to high fidelity designs created using the Figma design tool. Figma provides a digital design environment that allows designers to create polished and visually appealing interfaces. High fidelity UI designs in Figma incorporate detailed visual elements, typography and colors.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
#### <b>Testing Strategies and Techniques</b>
We had employed a combination of manual and automated testing strategies to ensure the quality and reliability of the Attendance System.Test-driven development (TDD) approach was followed, where test cases were created before writing the actual code. This helped in driving the development process and ensuring that the code met the specified requirements.

#### <b>Types of testing conducted</b><br><br>
1)User Acceptance Testing (UAT):<br>
Stakeholders and end-users were involved in UAT to validate the system’s usability, functionality, and adherence to their requirements. Feedback from UAT sessions was collected and incorporated into the system’s refinement.<br><br>
2)Usability Testing:<br>
The team conducted usability tests to evaluate the ease of use and intuitiveness of the user interface. Feedback from users was collected to identify any usability issues and make iterative improvements to the system’s design.<br><br>
3)Integration Testing:<br>
The integration of various modules was tested to ensure proper communication and data flow between them. Integration tests were performed to verify the interaction of backend APIs with the frontend user interface.

#### <b>Quality Assurance Processes</b><br><br>
1)Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:<br>
Comprehensive documentation was maintained to provide guidelines for testing procedures, test cases, and quality assurance processes. This documentation served as a reference for future maintenance and enhancement activities and ensured knowledge sharing among team members.<br><br>
2)Prototype Validation:<br>
The team regularly shared low-fidelity prototypes and design mock-ups with stakeholders and users for validation and feedback. THis process helped identify design flaws, usability issues, and potential improvements early on.<br><br>
3)Peer Review and Collaboration:<br>
The team promoted a collaborative environment where members reviewed each other’s work, provided constructive feedback, and ensured adherence to project goals and standards.<br><br>
4)Project Evaluation:<br>
At the end of the project, the team conducted a comprehensive evaluation to assess the overall success of the project. This involved reviewing project objectives, stakeholder feedback, and any quantitative or qualitative data collected during the testing phase.
