# Software Requirements Specifications 
The IEEE Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document is a standard document format developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) that provides a comprehensive description of the software requirements for a particular software system. The SRS document serves as a key communication tool between the software developers and the clients or stakeholders, who are responsible for defining the software's functionality, performance, and other non-functional requirements.

## üîó [Instructions](instruction.md)
To produce the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document, you are required to complete two tasks:

- **Task 1**: involves stakeholders, task delegation and project execution.
- **Task 2**: involves preparing the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document.

## üîó [List of Groups](srs-group.md)
A team project for IEEE Software Requirements Specifications documentation involves multiple users working together to create a comprehensive document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system. The project typically involves a Project Management Group, Requirements Gathering Group, Design Group, Development Group, Testing Group, and Documentation Group. Each group member has specific responsibilities and tasks, such as planning, organizing, gathering requirements, designing, implementing, testing, and documenting the software system. By working together, the groups can ensure that the software development process is efficient, effective, and produces high-quality software systems that meet the needs of their users. Effective communication, collaboration, and coordination between the groups are essential to ensure that the project meets its objectives and is delivered on time and within budget. The team project for IEEE Software Requirements Specifications documentation plays a vital role in ensuring that the software system meets the required standards and criteria and meets the expectations of its users.

## Guidelines for creating an IEEE Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document:
1. **Identify and involve all relevant stakeholders**: Make sure that all stakeholders, including clients, users, developers, and testers, are involved in the requirements gathering process.
2. **Define the scope of the software system**: Clearly define the scope of the software system and identify the business needs that the software system must meet.
3. **Use clear and concise language**: Use clear and concise language to describe the software requirements, avoiding technical jargon and ambiguous terms.
4. **Organize the document into sections**: Organize the SRS document into sections that correspond to the different types of requirements, such as functional and non-functional requirements.
5. **Use a consistent format**: Use a consistent format for each section of the document, including headings, subheadings, and numbering.
6. **Use examples to illustrate requirements**: Use examples to illustrate the requirements and make them more concrete.
7. **Include diagrams and visual aids**: Use diagrams and visual aids, such as flowcharts or use cases, to help explain complex requirements.
8. **Define acceptance criteria**: Clearly define acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure that the software system meets the client's expectations.
9. **Review and validate the document**: Review and validate the SRS document with stakeholders to ensure that it accurately reflects their requirements and expectations.
By following these guidelines, you can create a well-organized and comprehensive IEEE SRS document that accurately reflects the requirements of the software system and serves as an effective communication tool between stakeholders.

## List of Activities
The IEEE Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document typically includes the following activities:

| No | Topic | Description | 
| :-----: | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Requirements gathering | Gathering information from stakeholders about the software system's functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, security, reliability, and usability.|
| 2 | Requirements analysis | Analyzing the requirements to identify any conflicts, ambiguities, or inconsistencies.|
| 3 | Requirements specification | Specifying the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner, using appropriate language and notation.|
| 4 | Requirements validation | Validating the requirements with stakeholders to ensure that they accurately reflect their needs and expectations.|
| 5 | Requirements management | Managing changes to the requirements throughout the software development life cycle, including identifying and documenting any changes and ensuring that all stakeholders are informed.|
| 6 | Traceability management | Establishing traceability between the requirements and other system artifacts, such as design documents, test cases, and user manuals, to ensure that all requirements are met.|
| 7 | Quality assurance | Ensuring that the SRS document meets the required quality standards, including completeness, correctness, and consistency.|
| 8 | Communication and collaboration | Communicating and collaborating with stakeholders throughout the requirements engineering process to ensure that their needs and expectations are understood and met.|

By carrying out these activities, the IEEE SRS document can serve as a key communication tool between stakeholders and software developers, ensuring that the software system meets the requirements and expectations of its users.

## SRS Document
The SRS document typically contains the following sections:
1. **Introduction**: This section provides an overview of the software system and the purpose of the SRS document.
2. **Overall Description**: This section describes the software system's context, its users, and the business needs that the software system must meet.
3. **Specific Requirements**: This section contains a detailed description of the software system's functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, security, reliability, and usability.
4. **External Interface Requirements**: This section describes the interfaces between the software system and external systems or devices, including hardware, software, and communication protocols.
5. **System Features**: This section describes the software system's features, including the user interface, data management, and system functionality.
6. **Other Non-Functional Requirements**: This section contains additional non-functional requirements, such as legal, regulatory, or ethical requirements.
7. **Appendices**: This section contains any additional information that is relevant to the SRS document, such as glossary terms, acronyms, or references.
The IEEE SRS document provides a structured and standardized way of documenting software requirements that facilitates communication between stakeholders, reduces misunderstandings, and improves the overall quality of the software system.
