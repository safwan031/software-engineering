# SRS: Instructions

When producing the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document, you will need to complete two distinct tasks. 

## [Task 1](#task-1-activity)
The first task, will involve working with stakeholders to identify their requirements, delegating tasks, and executing the project plan. In this task, it is important to identify all stakeholders and ensure that their requirements are clearly understood and documented. This may involve conducting interviews or surveys, reviewing existing documentation, and holding meetings to discuss expectations and concerns. 

Additionally, task delegation is an important aspect of this task, as you will need to assign responsibilities to team members and monitor progress to ensure that project milestones are being met.

## [Task 2](#task-2-document)
Task 2 is focused specifically on preparing the Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document. This task involves gathering and organizing all of the requirements identified in Task 1 into a comprehensive and structured document. The SRS document should include detailed information on the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, as well as any performance and reliability requirements. It should also include any necessary diagrams or flowcharts to help illustrate the requirements and how they fit together. Throughout this task, it is important to ensure that the SRS document is accurate, complete, and well-organized, so that it can be used as a reliable guide throughout the development process.

## SRS: Activities and documents related to SRS

To enter and update activities and documents related to the IEEE Software Requirements Specifications (SRS), each group should follow these instructions:

1. **Assign roles and responsibilities**: Assign roles and responsibilities to each group member, such as requirements gatherer, analyst, specifier, validator, or manager.

2. **Define the structure of the document**: Define the structure of the document, including the sections and subsections that will be used to organize the activities and documents related to the SRS.

3. **Enter activities and documents**: Enter the activities and documents related to the SRS into the appropriate sections and subsections of the document, using clear and concise language and appropriate notation.

4. **Update the document regularly**: Update the document regularly as new activities and documents are identified or as changes are made to existing ones.

5. **Track progress**: Track the progress of each activity and document by using a status column, such as "not started," "in progress," "completed," or "validated."

6. **Collaborate and communicate**: Collaborate and communicate with other group members to ensure that all activities and documents are entered and updated correctly and that everyone is aware of the progress and status of each item.

By following these instructions, each group can effectively enter and update the activities and documents related to the IEEE SRS, ensuring that all requirements are gathered, analyzed, specified, validated, managed, and traced accurately and efficiently.

## Task 1: Activity

### 1. Information about stakeholders
Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the success of a project. They can be internal or external to an organization and can include customers, employees, managers, investors, suppliers, regulators, and more. Each column in a stakeholder table for a Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) document is described below:

1. **Name**: The name of the stakeholder, which can be an individual or an organization.
2. **Stakeholder**: The stakeholder refers to the individual or group that has a vested interest in the success of the project. This can include project sponsors, end-users, customers, developers, testers, and other stakeholders who will be affected by the project outcome.
3. **Position**: The position refers to the role or title of the stakeholder within the organization or project team. For example, a project sponsor, end-user, or developer may hold different positions within the project team.
4. **Responsibility**: The responsibility column describes the specific responsibilities of the stakeholder within the project. This can include providing feedback on project requirements, reviewing project documentation, testing the software, or providing input on project decisions.

In the context of Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) for a university academic course registration system, stakeholders can be identified as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Stakeholder</th>
    <th>Position</th>
    <th>Responsibility</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Low Ying Xi</td>
    <td>Faculty Member</td>
    <td>Professor</td>
    <td>Provide input on course requirements and scheduling</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Lim Jing Yong</td>
    <td>Faculty Member</td>
    <td>Lecturer</td>
    <td>Provide input on course requirements and scheduling</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Jaslene Yu</td>
    <td>Faculty Member</td>
    <td>Lecturer</td>
    <td>Provide input on course requirements and scheduling</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Arini Fatihah</td>
    <td>Administrator</td>
    <td>Registrar</td>
    <td>Ensure system meets administrative needs for registration and enrollment</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Soh Han Wei</td>
    <td>Student</td>
    <td>Postgraduate</td>
    <td>Provide feedback on usability and functionality of system from a student perspective</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Nur Farah Adibah</td>
    <td>Student</td>
    <td>Undergraduate</td>
    <td>Provide feedback on usability and functionality of system from a student perspective</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Lee Soon Der</td>
    <td>Student</td>
    <td>Postgraduate</td>
    <td>Provide feedback on usability and functionality of system from a student perspective</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aliatul Izzah Jasman</td>
    <td>IT Staff</td>
    <td>Systems Analyst</td>
    <td>Ensure system is technically feasible and meets security requirements</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In this example, the stakeholders listed include students (both undergraduate and graduate), a faculty member (professor, lecturer), a registrar, and an IT staff member (system administrator). The table includes columns for the stakeholder name, their stakeholder type, and their position or role within the university academic course registration system.



### 2. Task Delegation and Project Execution

This information pertains to the project team members and how to list their roles and assigned tasks in a table for the IEEE Software Requirements Specifications documentation. The table should have a section for tasks that are complete, partially complete, and incomplete. If an assigned task is not done and has been assigned to another team member, this information should be stated in the table as well. The table should include the following columns:

- **Member Name**: The name of the team member
- **Role**: The role or position of the team member in the project
- **Task**: The specific task or responsibility assigned to the team member
- **Status**: The current status of the assigned task (complete, partially complete, incomplete)
- **Date**: The date when the status was last updated

By organizing the team members' roles and assigned tasks in this way, the project manager can easily track the progress of the project and identify any tasks that are falling behind schedule. It also helps team members to see their responsibilities and understand the status of the tasks they are working on. With this information readily available in a table format, the project manager can make informed decisions about resource allocation, adjust timelines and schedules, and ensure the project is delivered on time and within budget.


An example of a lists tasks in the IEEE Software Requirements Specifications documentation:

| Member Name | Role	| Task	| Status	| Date |
| ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Camily Tang | Project Manager | Create project plan | Complete | 01/01/2022|
| Wan Nur Sofea | Requirements Analyst | Gather user requirements | Partially Complete | 02/15/2022|
| Neo Zheng Weng | Designer | Create system architecture design | Complete | 01/10/2022|
| Chai Yu Tong | Developer | Implement software functionality | Incomplete (assigned to Thevan Raju) | 03/01/2022|
| Thevan Raju | Developer | Implement remaining software functionality | Incomplete | 03/01/2022|
| Ariff Danish | Tester | Create testing plan and execute tests | Incomplete | 04/01/2022|
| Bernice Lim  | Documentation Specialist | Create system documentation | Partially Complete | 02/28/2022|

In this example, the table lists the team members, their roles, the tasks they are responsible for, the status of each task, and the date when the status was last updated. The date column provides a clear record of when each task was last updated and helps track the progress of the project over time. For instance, we can see that Camily Tang completed the project plan on January 1st, 2022, and that Bernice Lim  partially completed the system documentation on February 28th, 2022. Additionally, we can see that Chai Yu Tong assigned the task of implementing software functionality to Thevan Raju on March 1st, 2022, and that both developers have not yet completed their assigned tasks as of that date.
