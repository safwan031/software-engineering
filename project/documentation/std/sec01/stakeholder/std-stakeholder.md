# Project Implementation Plan
## 1. Objectives
Project implementation is crucial to put plans into practise, accomplish project goals, produce deliverables, efficiently manage resources, react to changes, track progress, involve stakeholders, and promote learning and development. It serves as a link between concepts and outcomes, transforming project ideas into concrete results.

The project implementation objectives are the desired outcomes that we do hope to achieve during the project execution phase. These objectives act as a guide and provide a clear direction for us to ensure the project's success. 

Objectives of project implementation:
1. Timely completion: The project should be finished within the timeframe specified, with all deadlines and milestones met.
2. Budget adherence: Carry out the project while staying within the specified budget and managing resources effectively to avoid cost overruns.
3. High-quality delivery: Ensure that the project is carried out in accordance with the set standards and specifications, resulting in an extraordinary hostel system.
4. Stakeholder satisfaction: Aim to meet the expectations and needs of project stakeholders, such as client (KTDI admin), and end users (UTM students, KTDI staff and KTDI fellow).
5. Efficient resource utilisation: Maximise productivity while minimising waste by optimising the use of resources such as personnel, equipment, and materials.

## 2.Tasks Breakdown
1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis:
- Conduct in-depth interviews, surveys, and workshops with key stakeholders (KTDI staff, administrators, students) to gather detailed requirements for the accommodation system.
- Analyze existing accommodation processes and identify pain points and areas for improvement.
- Define user stories, use cases, and acceptance criteria to capture both functional and non-functional requirements.
- Prioritize and validate requirements through iterative feedback sessions with stakeholders.

2. System Design and Architecture:
- Design the overall system architecture, considering scalability, security, and integration with existing university systems.
- Create wireframes, mockups, or prototypes to visualize the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).
- Define the database schema, data models, and relationships required for managing student accommodation, bookings, and related data.
- Conduct design reviews with the development team and stakeholders to refine the system design.

3. Technology Selection and Infrastructure Setup:
- Research and evaluate appropriate technologies, frameworks, and tools for developing the accommodation system (e.g., programming languages, web frameworks, databases).
- Set up the necessary development environment, including servers, databases, and networking configurations.
- Establish version control, project management, and collaboration tools to facilitate team communication and productivity.

4. Application Development:
- Develop a user-friendly interface for students to apply for accommodation, view available rooms, and make rent payments.
- Implement the backend logic for managing student applications, room allocations, payment processing, and related business rules.
- Integrate the system with existing university systems (e.g., student information system, billing system) to synchronize relevant data and ensure data consistency.
- Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to track and address system issues.

5. Data Analysis and Reporting:
- Implement data analysis capabilities to generate reports on occupancy rates, revenue, and other relevant metrics.
- Develop dashboards and visualizations to provide administrators with insights for decision-making and monitoring key performance indicators.
- Integrate the system with business intelligence tools or frameworks for advanced data analysis and visualization capabilities.

6. Maintenance and Repair Tracking:
- Develop a system for students to submit maintenance requests, track the progress of repairs, and provide feedback on the quality of service.
- Implement a scheduling mechanism for proactive maintenance and inspections to ensure a well-maintained accommodation facility.
- Integrate the system with relevant stakeholders (maintenance staff, administrators) for efficient communication and task management.

7. Testing and Quality Assurance:
- Conduct comprehensive testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, to ensure the system functions correctly and meets the specified requirements.
- Perform usability testing to validate the user experience and gather feedback for further improvements.
- Address any bugs or issues discovered during testing and ensure the system is stable, reliable, and performs well under varying loads.

8. UI Design:
- Conduct user research and usability studies to understand the needs, preferences, and expectations of the students, staff, and administrators using the accommodation system.
- Create UI wireframes, mockups, or prototypes using design tools or UI/UX software to visualize the layout, navigation, and interactions of the system.
- Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that aligns with the university's branding guidelines and enhances the overall user experience.

9. Version Control using GitHub:
- Set up a repository on GitHub to manage the source code and track changes made during development.
- Commit and push code regularly to maintain a comprehensive history of changes.
- Monitor the repository for updates, address conflicts, and merge changes after review and testing.
- Utilize version control features to tag and manage releases, allowing easy rollback and traceability of changes.
