### 1. Executive Summary
- Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.

### 2. Background:
- The introduction should provide background information about the software project and the purpose of the proposal. 
- It should also briefly describe the problem the software is meant to solve, the benefits it will provide, and its potential impact on the organization.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software. 
- It should also describe any limitations or constraints that may affect the project.

### 5. Software Process Model:
This section describe the ideal software process model for this system development. The write-up must consist of:
- Explanation of the goal of the software process model.
- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
- The budget section should outline the costs associated with the development of the software, including hardware, software, personnel, and testing. It should also include any contingency plans for unexpected expenses.

### 7. System Architecture:
- Provide a detailed overview of the proposed system architecture including the tools and technologies that will be used to develop and deploy the system
- Explain how the data will be stored, managed, and analyzed, as well as the hardware and software requirements needed to support the system.
- Discuss the tools and frameworks that will be used for data visualization and analysis.
- Provide a flowchart or block diagram of the system architecture.

### 8. Risks Assessment:
- The risk assessment section identifies and assesses any potential risks that could impact the project, such as technical challenges, resource constraints, or changes in project requirements. 
- It should also describe the plans and strategies to mitigate those risks.

### 9. Resources:
- Provide a detailed breakdown of the resources required for the proposed project, including staff, equipment, software, and other expenses.

### 10. Technical Specifications:
- Discuss the technical specifications of the proposed project, including data sources, data schema, data transformations, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools, and other technical details.
- Mention the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries that will be used in the project.
- Provide details about the hardware and software requirements for the proposed system.
- Explain the data security measures that will be implemented.

### 11. Timeline and Deliverables: 
- Provide a detailed timeline for the project, including milestones and deadlines.
- Specify the deliverables that will be provided at each milestone. It should also specify the expected time frame for each deliverable and the resources that will be required to complete the project.
- Explain the quality assurance and testing procedures that will be followed.

### 12. Conclusion:
- Conclude your proposal with a call to action, highlighting the benefits of your proposed solution and urging the decision-makers to take action.
- Summarize the proposal and reiterate the importance of the project.
- Mention any potential limitations or challenges that may arise during the project.
