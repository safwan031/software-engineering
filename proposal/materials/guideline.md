# Guideline for Software Engineering Proposal

A software engineering proposal is a document that outlines a plan for developing software. It describes the purpose of the software, its objectives, scope, and methodology for its development, as well as a detailed timeline, budget, and risk assessment. The proposal is typically submitted to stakeholders, such as clients or project sponsors, who use it to make informed decisions about the project. The proposal is an important step in the software development process as it serves as a blueprint for the development team, providing guidance and direction throughout the project's lifecycle. It ensures that all parties involved are on the same page and have a clear understanding of the project's goals and objectives.

Your team will need to identify a system as a case study to be proposed for the project. This case study can be either a newly designed system or an enhancement of the current available system. The proposed case study can also be derived from two situations: 
1. Manual or not fully computerized/automated system yet:
If the case study is a manual or not fully computerized/automated system, your team will need to identify and analyze the problems with the current system. This analysis should identify any inefficiencies or issues with the current system that could be addressed through automation or computerization. The proposed solution should include the design and development of a new system that improves upon the current system and addresses the identified issues.

2. Existing computerized/automated systems that are having problems:
If the case study is an existing computerized/automated system that is having problems, your team will need to identify and analyze the problems with the current system. This analysis should identify any inefficiencies or issues with the current system that could be addressed through enhancements or improvements. The proposed solution should include the design and development of an improved system that addresses the identified issues.

## Additional details about the proposal

1. This task must be completed in groups of no more than **five** persons (minimum 4 persons).
2. You must establish a project group and enter your title in Google Sheets [section 01](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVamYLFglM-v4twd29Qi4-z1N5RqPQ5FpucFI0Qv-wI/edit?usp=sharing) or [section 02](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CXVsz0EJqPTc0nS7GggXjWV8f3SXR0l_kG_dLg1IO5M/edit?usp=sharing).
3. Please use the [proposal template](./template-proposal.md) provided.
4. Each group must submit their proposal to either [sec01](../submission/sec01) or [sec02](../submission/sec02). Please save your proposal file in a new folder named after your group. The proposal should be formatted in **markdown**.
5. The proposal should be created with the participation of **all group members**.
6. You can get ideas for system development from [List of Software Engineering Projects](./list-se-topic.md).
7. This project requires **stakeholders**. Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest or investment in the project's success. They are individuals who are either directly or indirectly affected by the project's outcomes. Stakeholders can include project sponsors, project team members, customers, users, suppliers, regulatory bodies, and the wider community.

## List of activities
These system development projects can also be customized to meet the specific needs and requirements of the university and its students. The key is to identify the areas that require improvement and develop a system that addresses those issues while providing value to the student community.

| No | Topic | Description | 
| :-----: | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Choose a Project Idea | Brainstorm a list of potential project ideas as a group, then select one that interests everyone. It's important to choose an idea that is challenging enough to showcase your skills but also feasible to complete within the given timeline|
| 2 | Define the Project Scope | Clearly define the project's scope, goals, objectives, and expected outcomes. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page about what needs to be achieved|
| 3 | Develop a Project Proposal | Create a project proposal that outlines the project's purpose, scope, requirements, deliverables, timeline, and estimated budget| Use this proposal to pitch your project idea to your instructor for approval|
| 4 | Divide Roles and Responsibilities | Divide roles and responsibilities among the group members based on their skills and strengths| This will help ensure that everyone has a specific role to play in the project and that all aspects of the project are covered|
| 5 | Create a Project Plan | Develop a comprehensive project plan that outlines the project's timeline, milestones, deliverables, and resource allocation| Use project management tools such as Trello or Asana to track progress and assign tasks|
| 6 | Choose the Technology Stack | Choose the appropriate technology stack for the project based on the requirements| This should include the programming language, frameworks, and libraries | Make sure that everyone in the group has a basic understanding of the chosen technology stack |
| 7 | Develop the System | Begin developing the system according to the project plan| Divide the project into manageable sprints and set goals for each sprint| Use version control tools such as Git to manage code changes|
| 8 | Test and Debug the System | Thoroughly test and debug the system to ensure that it meets all of the requirements and functions as intended. This should include both functional and non-functional testing|
| 9 | Document the System | Document the system to ensure that it is easy to maintain and update.This should include documentation of the system architecture, design, and functionality|
| 10 | Present the Project| Prepare a presentation to showcase the project to your instructor and classmates. The presentation should include an overview of the project, its features, and the technologies used. Demonstrate the system's functionality and highlight any challenges and lessons learned during the project|

The software engineering proposal should identify a case study and propose a solution to develop a new or improved system based on the system analysis and design methodology. The project should be managed using project management methodologies like Agile or Waterfall to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.

## Proposal Key Components
A software engineering project proposal should contain several key components to provide a clear and detailed plan for the development of software. Here are the most important components of a software engineering project proposal:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Start the proposal with a brief summary that highlights the main points of the project, including its goals, objectives, and expected outcomes.

### 2. Background:
- The introduction should provide background information about the software project and the purpose of the proposal. 
- It should also briefly describe the problem the software is meant to solve, the benefits it will provide, and its potential impact on the organization.

### 3. Objectives:
- The objectives section should clearly state the goals and objectives of the software project. It should describe the intended outcomes of the software and how it will address the problem it aims to solve. 
- Objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

### 4. Scope: 
- The scope section defines the boundaries of the project and outlines what features and functionality will be included in the software.

- Choose the ideal software process model and give justification.
- The illustration of chosen software process model that relates to your project and shows every phase involved in the chosen software process model
- Describe detailed activities that are relevant to every phase of the software process model (you may use a Gantt chart or any suitable project management tool). Determine the suitable duration for every phase and assign the person in charge. Also, propose the appropriate deliverables/products/outputs for every phase. 
- It should also describe the testing methodologies, project management practices, and quality assurance processes.

### 6. Budget:
