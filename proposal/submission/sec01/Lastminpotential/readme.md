Agile methodology is a flexible and iterative approach to project management that emphasizes collaboration, frequent feedback, and rapid prototyping. Here's a more detailed breakdown of how the agile methodology will be used for the development of this system:
 

#### Project Development Phases

##### Planning Phase:
During the planning phase, the project manager, Tan Jun Yuan, will define the project goal and scope, identify the project's purpose, target audience, and desired outcome. Within two weeks, Tan Jun Yuan will produce a paper outlining the essential specifications for our system. At the same time, the requirement analyst, Goh Jing Yang, will gather requirements and choose user stories. The deliverables for this phase will be the requirements document and user stories. This phase will last for four weeks.

##### Design Phase:
During the design phase, the UI/UX system designer, Goh Jing Yang, will work on the project's architecture while designing a mockup of the user interface. The stakeholders will be involved in this step to ensure that all the requirements are considered. Routine checks will be conducted to ensure that the design process has taken into account all of the requirements. This phase will prioritize the identification of the project's functionality and the creation of a diagram that outlines all the requirements. The duration for this phase will be around four weeks.

##### Develop, Testing, Deploy and Review Phase:
The Develop, Testing, Deploy and Review phase is a critical phase in the software development process. During this phase, the development team creates and implements the system, while continuously testing and ensuring that the end system meets all the requirements and functions effectively. This phase is vital to the success of the project, as it ensures that the system meets the needs of the users and stakeholders.

The development team, led by the main developer, Loo Jia Chang, and assisted by Chen Pyng Haw, works closely with the project manager to prioritize iterations and functionalities. They will work in sprints lasting one to two weeks, during which they will focus on a specific set of user stories or functionality. Each sprint will end with a review where the team will demonstrate their progress to stakeholders and receive feedback.

During each sprint, the development team will focus on delivering regular working software releases. These releases are functional versions of the system that the team can gather feedback from users and stakeholders. The feedback allows the team to make necessary adjustments early in the development process and ensure that the system meets the user's needs.

Quality assurance is another important part of the Develop, Testing, Deploy and Review phase. The development team conducts regular tests throughout the development process to ensure that the system functions as expected and meets all requirements. This process involves various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

Once the system is complete, it is deployed to the appropriate environment. This may involve creating multiple environments, such as a testing environment and a production environment, to ensure that the system functions correctly in different scenarios. Before deploying the product, the development team conducts final testing to ensure that it is ready for release.

The Develop, Testing, Deploy and Review phase typically lasts around 10 weeks. However, the duration may vary depending on the complexity of the project and the number of features to be implemented. During this phase, the development team works closely with stakeholders, such as the project manager, system owner, and users, to ensure that the system meets their expectations.

##### Launch Phase:
During the launch phase, the quality assurance team will conduct tests to ensure the software's functionality prior to the product's release. The QA team will test the program to ensure that the code is clear. If there are any possible issues or defects, the development team will take swift action to fix them. The duration for this phase will be two weeks. Once all work is done, the system will be launched.

| Phase | Tasks | Duration |
