### 1. Executive Summary:
Our proposed Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail (KTDI) Event Management System is a comprehensive solution that aims to simplify and streamline the processes of event management for the KTDI Student Residential College Committee (JKM) at University Technology Malaysia (UTM), KTDI staff members, as well as the students in UTM Johor.

Our system offers a range of key features that assist our stakeholders in event preparation and post-activity processes. One such key feature is the inclusion of a calendar for annual events. JKM KTDI will be able to plan and schedule their events for the semester in advance, avoiding scheduling conflicts. This feature also enables student to view event details and register for events. On the other hand, KTDI staff members are only able to view the event details.

Furthermore, our system has an attendance and feedback feature that enables the students who attended the event to offer insightful feedback on the events for potential future improvements. Students who participate in events are also given KTDI merit, which is automatically updated in the system to make it easier for the office to identify which students should be given preference when booking hostel space for the upcoming semester.

Additionally, our system enables JKM KTDI to distribute tasks to team members, allowing for efficient delegation and a smoother planning process. It helps JKM KTDI to handle the necessary documents for each activity, ensuring that all required paperwork is organised and easily accessible. With our system, the JKM KTDI and KTDI staff members can track their JKM KTDI's event progress and stay on top of their goals throughout the planning process. Lastly, after the event is over, it allows them to complete their activity with post-event reporting.

To summarise, our system is designed to make event management and execution as seamless as possible, allowing JKM KTDI to focus on delivering a successful event, KTDI staff members to monitor progress, and for the students to participate actively on the events held.

### 2. Background:
Events are an essential part of the Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail (KTDI) college. However, the current process of event preparation, registration, and post-activity processes is time-consuming and less productive. The KTDI Event Management System is designed to solve the problems and inconveniences faced by stakeholders in activity preparation and improve the effectiveness of event preparation. 

One of the issues faced by JKM KTDI is the problem of event dates crashing, which occurs due to the manual event preparation process. Our proposed system addresses this challenge by introducing a calendar for annual events. This feature enables KTDI Student Residential College Committee (JKM) to plan and schedule their events for the semester in advance, avoiding scheduling conflicts and allowing for the allocation of resources accordingly. With the calendar for annual events, JKM KTDI can quickly identify which dates are already reserved and which are available, making it easier to plan and organise events in a systematic manner.

Additionally, JKM KTDI and KTDI staff members need to conduct multiple meetings to ensure team progression, which can be time-consuming. The KTDI Event Management System helps by enabling the assignment of tasks and tracking progress, thus reducing the number of long and tedious meetings held. Furthermore, the system allows for post-event reporting, providing a centralised platform for storing event photos. Hence, ensuring that KTDI events' management is accurate, efficient, and productive. 

Furthermore, JKM KTDI is required to manually compute the merit points of KTDI students, which determines their active quota for priority in booking the hostel for the upcoming semester. However, this process is time-consuming and prone to human errors during calculation. The KTDI Event Management System alleviates this burden by automatically updating the accumulated merit points, thereby simplifying the tasks of JKM KTDI members involved in determining the active quota.

On the contrary, students often encounter difficulties in finding college events due to the overwhelming number of events being shared on social media platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram. This flood of information makes it challenging for students to distinguish between different events. However, with the KTDI Event Management System, students gain access to a centralized calendar where they can easily locate and register for the events they find interesting. This system eliminates the need for students to engage in laborious tasks of scrolling through countless events organized by various clubs or colleges.

In summary, the KTDI Event Management System proposal seeks to address the challenges associated with the current manual event management process by introducing a modern, organised, and user-friendly solution that provides measurable benefits and enhances the overall experience of all stakeholders. The proposed system has the potential to make the event management process more streamlined and manageable, leading to more successful and enjoyable events.

### 4. Scope: 
### Limitation: 
Our proposed system, KTDI Event Management System, is designed to provide a web-based platform specifically for the management of events within Kolej Tun Dr. Ismail (KTDI). The system is intended for use by the Student Residential College Committee (JKM), the KTDI staff members, as well as the students.

### Features:
### JKM KTDI
* <b>Event Calendar</b><br>
The calendar for events feature is an essential tool that enables JKM KTDI to plan their events efficiently. With this feature, the committee can schedule events that is going to be held within the semester. This feature ensures that the events do not clash with each other, and they can allocate their resources efficiently to ensure the success of each event. Besides, they can utilise this feature to upload event details and registration link for the students. The calendar feature provides a centralised platform for JKM KTDI members to stay updated on upcoming events. This accessibility ensures that all members are well-informed and can plan their tasks accordingly. By having a clear overview of the event schedule, members can effectively manage their time and responsibilities, contributing to the smooth execution of each event.

* <b>Active Quota</b><br>
The system incorporates an active quota feature that provides a comprehensive view of the students currently residing in KTDI college, their respective college merit points earned through event participation, and the total merit points accumulated. This information plays a crucial role in determining the priority for students' hostel booking in the upcoming year. By considering the merit points earned through event participation, the active quota feature incentivizes student engagement and active involvement in college activities. Students who actively participate and contribute to events have the opportunity to earn more merit points, increasing their chances of securing preferred hostel accommodations.

* <b>Task distribution</b><br>
The system's ability to streamline the event preparation and post-activity process will make it easier for the JKM KTDI committee to manage their events. By providing this system, the committee can upload relevant documents and track the progress of each unit involved in the event. This feature will save time and reduce the risk of errors during the event planning process. The JKM members can ensure that they are on track with their work, and the overall progress of the event is visible to all members. This feature makes it easier for the higher authorities to monitor the progress of the event and identify areas that need improvement.

* <b>Upload and view registration, attendance and feedback link </b><br>
The system incorporates a valuable feature that empowers JKM to upload registration links directly to the event calendar. This functionality streamlines the process of event registration for students, making it convenient and efficient. By uploading the registration link alongside event details, JKM facilitates easy access for students to sign up for events that pique their interest. In addition to event registration, the system also offers an attendance and feedback link for students who have attended the events. This enables JKM to collect valuable feedback and insights from the participants, facilitating continuous improvement and enhancement of future events. To ensure the student that registered attends the event, a "Secret Code" is compulsory to be filled in by the student. This code is provided anytime during the event to gurantee that the students attend pay attention and to eliminate the sharing of the forms to other students that did not participate. By providing a direct link for attendance and feedback, the system streamlines the process for students to share their thoughts, suggestions, and evaluations regarding the events they have attended.

* <b> View participant list, attendance and feedbacks obtained </b><br>
Once students register for the event, JKM KTDI will be able to received an organised list of participants that display the details of the students in table form. The list includes information such as the name, matrics number, contact details, and any other relevant data collected during the registration process. The attendance and feedback collection on the other hand helps JKM KTDI to monitor and record the presence or absence of participants at the event as well as to gain valuable insights and feedback from participants about their event experience. These will help JKM KTDI in assessing their strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for improvement and make informed decision for future event planning.

* <b> JKM Profile </b><br>
The detailed information about each JKM member's participation in events, positions held during events, merit points earned, total merit points accumulated, and active quota status is provided in our system's comprehensive profile feature, which is a feature of our system. A list of the events in which JKM members have served as crew members can be found in the JKM profile section. It demonstrates their involvement in the college community and commitment to it. Additionally, it draws attention to the particular roles they played—such as president, secretary, or other predetermined roles—during each event. The merit points that JKM members earned for each event they have taken part in are also shown in the profile feature. Their contributions and active participation in planning and carrying out successful events are measured by merit points. JKM members can show their commitment, leadership, and important contributions to the college's event management efforts by earning merit points. The JKM profile provides a cumulative total of merit points earned by each member across all events. This total reflects the overall level of commitment and engagement of JKM members in the college's event activities. The profile also shows the active quota status, which shows how many events they can still actively participate in for the current academic year. The JKM profile is a tool for self-evaluating their performance and involvement of JKM members in event management. 

### KTDI Staff Members
* <b>Event Calendar</b><br>
The calendar feature of the system will enable staff members of KTDI to view progress and upcoming events held by JKM KTDI. By utilising the calendar, the staff members can stay informed about upcoming events, important dates, and the overall event schedule. This eliminate the need for staff members to search for event updates or rely on multiple sources of information. Instead, they can conveniently access the calendar within the system, gaining a comprehensive overview of the planned events. This streamlines communication and coordination within the KTDI organization, ensuring that staff members are well-informed and aligned with the activities and objectives of JKM KTDI.

* <b>View Task Distribution</b><br>
The system enables KTDI staff members to access a task distribution feature. This feature allows the staff to view the tasks done by JKM KTDI members. Staff members can easily monitor the progress of tasks, track their status, and ensure timely completion. Within the task distribution module, staff members can view the assigned tasks, and the responsible individuals towards the task. This allows them to have a comprehensive overview of the ongoing activities within JKM KTDI. They can quickly identify any potential bottlenecks, address resource allocation issues, and provide necessary support or guidance to team members.

* <b>View participant list, attendance and feedback of students</b></br>
The system provides a dedicated section for KTDI staff members to access attendance and feedback data from students who attended events. This section serves as a centralized repository of information related to event attendance and participant feedback. Staff members can view the attendance records, which provide details such as the number of students who attended each event, the specific individuals who participated, and the overall turnout. This attendance data allows staff members to evaluate the success and popularity of events, identify trends, and make informed decisions for future event planning. In addition to attendance, the system also enables staff members to access feedback provided by students who attended events. This feedback can include ratings, comments, suggestions, and other relevant insights shared by participants. Staff members can review this feedback to gain valuable perspectives on the strengths and areas of improvement for each event.

* <b>Active Quota</b><br>
This system grants the KTDI staff members to have access to the active quota feature, which displays the relevant information on student event participation and merit points earned. Staff members can view the list of students and the total merit points accumulated by each student. They can then collaborate with JKM KTDI to discuss and determine the criteria for priority in booking hostel rooms. By analysing the active quota information, the staffs and JKM KTDI representatives can assess the level of student participation and contribution to events. Based on the evaluation of students' merit points, KTDI staff members, in consultation with JKM KTDI, can determine the order of priority for students when it comes to booking hostel rooms for the upcoming year. Students with higher merit points, indicating their active involvement in college events, may be given preferential treatment in the room allocation process. This prioritization ensures that students who have actively contributed to the college community are rewarded with a higher chance of securing their preferred accommodations.

### Students
* <b>Event Calendar</b><br>
The system provides an event calendar for the students that display the schedule of the events organised per semester by JKM KTDI. Students can access the calendar to view upcoming, ongoing, and previous events held by JKM KTDI. Once the student presses into the event, they will be able to view event details. This includes event description, objectives, time, location and any specific requirements or prerequisites. Students can gather all the necessary details from the calendar to make informed decisions about the events that they are interested in attending.

* <b>Registration, and attendance and feedback form</b><br>
Besides, for the convenience of the students, they can directly register to attend the events through the event calendar. Each event on the calendar will be provided a "Register" button that they can click to sign up for the event. This feature eliminates the need for additional steps and ensure the students can secure their spots for the events they wish to participate in. Conversely, the attendance and feedback form is made available to participants who have completed the registration process. A "Secret Code" will be required from the students to verify their attendance at the event. It serves as a means for participants to mark their attendance, indicating their presence at the event. FUrthermore, the feedback section within the form allows participants to freely evaluate, and provide insights as well as opinions regarding their event experience. They can show their throughts, suggestions, constructive critism, enabling JKM KTDI to gather comprehensive feedback that aids in assessing the event's success and identifying areas for improvement.

* <b>Active Quota</b><br>
Active quota for students refers to a predetermined maximum number of events that students actively participate in a year. This active quota ensures that students engage actively into KTDI events, with the benefit of having a priority in booking a hostel room every new study year. Students who actively participated in events and reached a high number of active quota are granted a higher priority during the room allocation process. This priority system acknowledges their commitment to the KTDI community and rewards then with an advantage when it comes to securing hostel accommodation. Thus, this merit points gained in total and active quota status can be viewed personally by each student in their respective profiles.

* <b> Student Profile </b><br>
The KTDI Event Management System includes a profile feature for students, which allows them to view their own participation in events, access the attendance and feedback forms, track the merit points gained for each event, monitor their total merit points, and check their active quota status. The student's participation in various activities is detailed in their profile. It lists the events that they have participated in or attended, giving them a clear picture of their level of involvement in the college community. For the events they have registered for and attended, students can access the attendance and feedback forms. Students can mark their attendance on these forms and provide insightful comments, opinions, and suggestions regarding the events they have attended. Students can actively contribute to the enhancement and improvement of upcoming events by gaining access to these forms. The student's merit points for each activity they took part in are displayed in their profile. It emphasises their level of commitment, involvement, and contribution to the events' success. Students can follow their development and accomplishments with the help of this information, which also serves as a reward for their active participation. The student's overall cumulative merit points from all events are also shown in the profile feature. This sum demonstrates the student's general level of involvement and commitment to taking part in college activities. The student's active quota status is also shown in the profile, along with how many events they can actively participate in for the remainder of the current academic year.

### 5. Software Process Model:
The <b>Agile software development process model</b> is the ideal software process model for this KTDI event management system development. The Agile process model is an adaptable and iterative method of developing software that places a focus on teamwork, client satisfaction, and the quick delivery of functional software. This process model emphasises delivering value to the user (JKM) at each iteration and is appropriate for projects with varying requirements and uncertainties.

The agile process model was chosen because it enables frequent feedback and changes to be made to the software while it is being developed. Since this system is being created for a university, it is likely that the requirements will change and be updated as the project moves forwards. The Agile process model is well suited to handle such changes and still deliver a high-quality product on time.

The Agile process model consists of the following phases:

### Testing Methodologies: 
The testing methodologies that will be used are black-box testing and white-box testing.

* <b>Black-Box Testing</b>:
Also referred to as functional testing or "behavioural testing", this is a testing technique where the tester is unaware of the internal workings of the system being tested. The tester in this method only has access to the system's inputs and outputs, and they test the system's functionality in accordance with its specifications and requirements. In the case of the KTDI event management system, end-users such as JKM KTDI, KTDI staff members, and students will conduct this kind of testing.

* <b>White-Box Testing </b>:
Also known as structural testing, is a testing technique where the tester is aware of how the system being tested operates on the inside. This approach involves running tests on the system's internal components, such as code or algorithms, to make sure they work as intended. Developers or testers with access to the source code of the system being tested usually carry out white-box testing. In the KTDI event management system, the team members will perform this type of testing.

* <b>System Testing:</b> For the KTDI event management system, system testing involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and functions as expected. This can involve testing various aspects of the system, including the user interface, event calendar, registration process and other key features. System testing helps to identify any bugs, errors, or issues that may impact the system's functionality, and ensures that the system is reliable and performs well under different scenarios. The team members will carry out system testing for the KTDI event management system.

* <b>Performance Testing:</b> This test focuses on assessing how well the system performs under various loads and stresses. It is beneficial to locate any performance problems or bottlenecks that could be affecting the stability, scalability, and responsiveness of the system. Performance testing for the KTDI event management system will involve creating realistic scenarios to test the system's throughput, response time, and resource usage under various user activity levels. A variety of metrics, including server response time, page load time, and network latency, will be measured during this testing using specialised tools and software. The system's performance will be optimised, any performance problems will be found, and the system's ability to handle the anticipated workload will be confirmed using the performance testing results. The team members are in charge of testing the KTDI event management system's performance.

### Project Management Practices: 
* <b>Agile Project Management:</b>  An effective project management strategy for software development projects is called agile. It entails segmenting the project into shorter, easier-to-manage units called sprints. A specific set of tasks is finished during each sprint, which is a brief, concentrated time frame.

* <b>Scrum:</b> Scrum is an agile project management framework for software development. It includes a number of rituals, roles, and artefacts that aid in making sure the project is completed on schedule, within budget, and in accordance with the necessary quality standards.

* <b>Daily Stand-up Meetings:</b> Daily stand-up meetings are quick, focused gatherings that occur each day. Team members share updates on their progress, discuss any difficulties they are having, and mention any dependencies they may have on other team members during these meetings.

* <b>Sprint Planning:</b> Each sprint starts with a planning session known as "sprint planning". The team reviews the backlog of work, chooses which tasks to include in the sprint, and determines how long it will take to complete each task during this meeting.

* <b>Sprint Review:</b> The team holds a sprint review meeting at the end of each sprint. The team presents the work that has been completed during the sprint during this meeting, and stakeholders provide feedback.

* <b>Retrospective Meetings:</b> The team holds a review session following each sprint. The team reviews the sprint during this meeting and pinpoints areas for development.


### Quality Assurance Processes: 
* <b>Testing Activities:</b> A crucial component of quality assurance is testing. By carrying out various testing tasks like black-box testing, white-box testing, and system testing, it will guarantee that the system complies with the quality standards . The purpose of the testing operations is to find any flaws or problems in the system and make sure it meets the demands of the stakeholders.

* <b>Test Reports:</b> The documentation specialist will also be responsible for creating test reports. These reports will summarise any issues found and include the testing activities' findings. The reports will be used to monitor the testing's progress and make sure the system is upholding the necessary quality standards.

* <b>Unit Testing:</b> The main developer and team members will also perform unit testing. Unit testing is a software testing technique that involves testing individual units or components of the system in isolation. The purpose of unit testing is to ensure that each unit of the system is working as intended and that there are no defects or errors in the code.

* <b>Code Reviews:</b> In addition to unit testing, the main developer and team members will also perform code reviews. Code reviews are a software quality assurance activity in which one or more developers review the code written by another developer. The purpose of code reviews is to identify defects or errors in the code and to ensure that the code is consistent with the project's coding standards and guidelines.

* <b>Continuous Integration:</b> Developers frequently integrate their code into a shared repository as part of the software development practise known as continuous integration. Continuous integration's goal is to guarantee that the code is properly integrated and that any problems or conflicts are quickly found and fixed. Additionally, continuous integration contributes to ensuring that the system operates as intended and complies with the necessary quality standards.

### 7. System Architecture:
The proposed system architecture for the KTDI event management system is a web-based system built using modern technologies and frameworks. The system will have a multi-tier architecture consisting of a presentation layer and  application layer. The presentation layer will be responsible for displaying the user interface and handling user interactions. The application layer will be responsible for implementing the business logic of the system and handling user requests. The system will require users to enter their email and password to gain access, limiting use to JKM KTDI, KTDI staff members, and students. All the users can register for their account using UTM email address for only one account and can reset their password in the system.

The system will have three interfaces catering to different roles: the JKM interface, KTDI Staff interface and Student interface. JKM members can use this system to upload the event that they are going to organise in the Event Calendar page. JKM members will be able to create spaces for handling the prepartion for each activity. Within these spaces, they can distribute tasks to different members, and progress is visible to all members, and staff involved. Users can upload their event-related documents to the system as the update to the task progress. JKM members can use this system to record the activities for record-keeping purposes. This may include the registration list, attendance and feedback lists and students' merit list that can serve as a reference for future JKM batches, fellows, and assistant fellows. From their profile, they can view the events they have been joined.

KTDI staff can view the event that will be organised at KTDI by JKM KTDI in the Event Calander page. KTDI staff can view the documents uploaded and check the progress of each unit of the activity. They can also access the record section to view the activities that have been organised. They can view students' merit to identify active quota students.

Student can use this system to register for the event in KTDI and view the detail of the event. They can use it to submit attendance and feedback to JKM members. Students can view their merit earned from each event that they have attended.

The overall testing procedures will be:<br><br>
<b>1. Black-Box Testing</b> (To validate the system's functionality and behaviour):<br>
This is carried out by end-users who are not aware of the internal workings of the system, such as JKM KTDI, KTDI staff members, and students. They test the system's functionality based on its specifications and requirements, using only its inputs and outputs.

<b>2. White-Box Testing</b> (To validate the system's internal components, such as code or algorithms):<br>
This is carried out by developers or testers who have access to the source code of the system being tested. This testing method involves running tests on the system's internal components to ensure they work as intended. The KTDI event management system team members will perform white-box testing.

<b>3. System Testing</b> (Conduct system testing to validate the system as a whole):<br>
This involves testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements and functions as expected. The KTDI event management system team members will carry out system testing, testing various aspects of the system, including the user interface, location booking system, paperwork management processes, and other key features.

<b>4. Performance Testing</b> (Conduct performance testing to validate the system's performance under different scenarios):<br>
Performance testing assesses how well the system performs under various loads and stresses. It involves creating realistic scenarios to test the system's throughput, response time, and resource usage under various user activity levels. The KTDI event management system team members are responsible for performance testing, using specialised tools and software to measure a variety of metrics, including server response time, page load time, and network latency. The system's performance will be optimised based on the performance testing results, any performance problems will be found, and the system's ability to handle the anticipated workload will be confirmed.

<b>5. Analyse Results and Report Defects</b> (Analyse the results of testing and report any defects or issues found):<br>
The development team of this project will work closely with the documentation specialist to create test reports summarising the results of testing, including any defects or issues found during the testing process. These reports will be used to monitor the testing's progress and ensure that the system is meeting the required quality standards. Any defects or issues found will be reported to the development team for resolution. The documentation specialist will be responsible for ensuring that all test reports are accurate and up-to-date.

<b>6. Retest and Validate Fixes:</b><br>
Retest any defects or issues found after they have been fixed by the development team. The testing team will verify that all defects and issues have been resolved before signing off on the system's release.

<b>7. Sign-Off:</b><br>
Sign off on the system's release after all testing is complete and all defects have been resolved.


### Quality Assurance Procedure
<b>1. Testing Activities:</b><br>
Perform black-box testing, white-box testing, and system testing to ensure the software meets quality standards and stakeholder requirements.
Document all test results, including any defects or issues found during testing.

<b>2. Test Reports:</b><br>
The documentation specialist is responsible for creating test reports summarising any issues found during testing and monitoring the testing progress.
Use the test reports to ensure the software is upholding the necessary quality standards.

### 12. Conclusion:
In conclusion, the proposed system will revolutionize event management for the KTDI community at University Technology Malaysia (UTM). It offers students the convenience of viewing upcoming events, registering for them, and providing feedback afterward. Additionally, the system enables seamless event management process among Student Residential College Committee (JKM) KTDI members and staff.

By providing a centralized platform, the system ensures that updates are easily accessible and organized. Users can access comprehensive information about registered participants, facilitating efficient event coordination. Furthermore, the system automates the calculation of students' college merit points for active quota allocation, streamlining the process. These features enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of event management for JKM KTDI. Students can conveniently engage in event activities, while JKM members and staff can efficiently monitor progress and manage event logistics.

It is important to note that further development may be required to expand the system's accessibility to other JKM committees and address additional aspects of event preparation. Challenges, such as large file uploads and ensuring system security, need to be carefully addressed during the project's implementation. The proposed system empowers students by providing event visibility, registration capabilities, and post-event feedback options. It offers JKM KTDI and KTDI staff a centralized platform to track progress and efficiently manage events. With its numerous advantages, the system promises to significantly enhance event management processes and reduce the workload for event organizers.
