### 1. Executive Summary
The Student Accommodation System for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) addresses the challenges students and staff face when managing and applying for student accommodation. The existing housing application and management process must be more time-consuming and integrated because it can cause delays, mistakes, and dissatisfaction for students and staff.

As a result, the proposed web application software system will offer a website where students can request accommodations, make payments, and check the status of their requests. KTDI administrator will be able to manage room availability and allocation and access relevant data and reports through a centralized dashboard. At the same time, the regular staff will be able to manage all of the applications submitted by the students via the website developed, and the fellow could also control KTDI merits throughout this system. In terms of maintenance, it is guaranteed that KTDI rooms will remain in good condition owing to the maintenance request and tracking functionality of the proposed accommodation system, giving students a comfortable and secure living environment.
The system will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with clear instructions and prompts throughout the process. It will also incorporate automated communication channels, such as email notifications, to keep students updated on the status of their applications and requests.

The project's expected outcomes include improved students and KTDI staff satisfaction, as the software system will provide a more convenient and streamlined process for managing and applying accommodation. KTDI staff will also benefit from increased efficiency, as the system will reduce the need for manual data entry and administrative tasks. Finally, the system is expected to reduce errors and delays in the accommodation application process, resulting in a more reliable and efficient system overall.

### 2. Background
Managing student accommodations in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) is a complex and challenging task. The current process is less flexible for KTDI staff and administrator when managing room applications, allocations, and rent payments which are vulnerable, inconsistencies, and time-consuming. Students face difficulties in applying hostel while selecting suitable room based on their preferences and accessibility due to the quota active set by the fellow, while KTDI staffs struggle with the workload of managing hundreds of applications daily and at the same time for the administration worker in allocating rooms manually.

To solve these issues, we propose a modern and intuitive Student Accommodation System that automates the room selection process, from application to allocation, and provides a seamless experience for students and KTDI staff. With the use of the latest technology and industry best practices, the system aims to simplify the process of applying for hostels online, selecting preferred rooms, and allocating suitable accommodations based on student preferences and their college merits.

The proposed system includes several key features, such as a user-friendly interface that integrates with other university systems like billing and student information, enhanced data analysis capabilities, and features that enable tracking maintenance requests, scheduling repairs and replacements, and registering electrical appliances. These features aim to improve the overall management and application of student accommodation, creating a comfortable and safe living environment for students and later enhancing their academic success and overall well-being.

The Student Accommodation System will also bring significant benefits to the stakeholders, such as increased efficiency, time-saving, and reduced errors during the application and management process. The online application process will simplify the application process for students, making it easier and more convenient for them to select their preferred rooms. The enhanced data analysis capabilities will provide administrator with insights into occupancy rates, maintenance records, revenue reports and college merits, enabling KTDI to make informed decisions about future room allocation. The maintenance system will ensure that the rooms remain well-maintained, supplying students with a cosy and secure living space during their studies.

In summary, the proposed Student Accommodation System aims to streamline the room rental and management process in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI), improving the student experience and providing administrator, staff, and fellow with more effective working operations. By automating the allocation process, enhancing data analysis capabilities, and improving maintenance systems, the system is with potential to create a more strategic and efficient approach to manage and apply student accommodation with ease, enhance the reputation of the university, and promote academic achievement and general experience of students in the university.

### 4. Scope
The scope refers to the boundaries of the project and outlines the features and functionalities of the system, including its goals, objectives and requirements as well as the expected outcomes and benefits. Detailed explanations of the features and functionality of our proposed Student Accommodation System in KTDI are as follows:

- Our proposed Student Accommodation System will be developed as a web application software with targeted users, as UTM students, KTDI staff, KTDI fellow council, and KTDI administrators.

- User registration: <br>By entering personal information and setting up a password with UTM ID or UTM email, new user can register as our website user before using the KTDI system. Each user will be registered with different role to access their own related web pages. However, the KTDI administrators will not have to register it, because admins are registered automatically by the system.

- Centralised Dashboard: <br>In both the user interfaces of the students, fellows, KTDI staff and also the adminstrative department will have a well looking dashboard to provide the users a easier and effective way to access their needs via the tools provided. The dashboard can provide students with current allocated college merits, personal information and hostel information such as facilities and services surround it, KTDI location and overview of college history. The personal profile dashboard could be edited by the students, but the hostel information dashboard could only be edited by the KTDI department, such as staff, fellow and admin.

- Hostel room application: <br>Students will allow to apply their accommodation via this proposed system. During applying, the system should provide a calendar view of the real time room availability and assist students to select their preferred room and check-in and check-out dates. Besides, students will have to fill in their personal information and academic programme information to apply for hostel.

- KTDI college merit calculator: <br>The fellow could manage and enter the student college merits based on the college activities that participated by them. Once the merits or marks are fully entered, the student quota active reports will be generated automatically. These reports will then be viewed mainly by the administrator to assist them in room application approvement and also the room allocation. Fellow will also be accessed to see the quota active. Whoever meets the minimum requirement of college merit marks will be given the priority to apply for the KTDI university dorms. This feature helps the fellow to reduce their works in manual and improve quota active report's accuracy.

- Room allocation: <br>According on the students' choices, room availability and KTDI merits, the automated system will support the admin in assignning rooms to them using the room allocation tool. The system should include elements including the student's academic programme, year of study and any unique requirements or requests, such as health condition in order to take note in the allocation process. This process will prioritise the students with higher hostel merits to prefer their desired available hostel block as well as room number. This feature brings convienience to the admin in allocating such a big number of students or KTDI residents.

- Room management: <br>The room management feature allows students to manage their rooms through the system. This includes room changing, room cancellation, check-in, check-out and all of these applications will be done via online. It should also allow students to request maintenance services for their room and track the status of the request. This system also allow students to register their brought electrical appliances. Finally, the KTDI staff can always control the applications of these room management of each student. This feature benefits the staff to increase their tasks effiency as the manual application forms will be reduced and replaced with online room management.

- Payment management: <br>Students can use the system to pay their lodging costs via the payment management tool. The system should enable students to monitor their payment history and receipts and offer safe payment options like internet banking and also convinence payment method, such as TnG e-wallet. The payment will include the fees of room rentaling, charges in extra electical appliances as well as the any sumon given by KTDI staff.

- Security: <br>To log in to the system, the students have to enter their UTM id and the correct password as the authentication steps. Same concept will be implemeted for the KTDI staff, fellows and administrator. This will protect the system from being accessed by other irrelevant authorities and so provide the user privacy.

- Reporting and analytics: <br>Administrator will be allowed to monitor and analyze the occupancy rates, revenue, and maintenance issues of the accommodation system , as well as the student quota active in a dashboard view. Automated reports from the system should include occupancy rates based on the study programme or room type, revenue by time period, building or room-specific maintenance issues and college quota active by each student. This will help the admin to view the overall information in ease and also support him in decision making.

- The student accommodation system will be limited to operation of Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) only but not all the hostels in UTM and the full process of room application management will be continued with the help of AIMS2000 system of UTM which will also be used by the KTDI administrator. Besides, our proposed system could only be accessed by the KTDI members and also UTM students.

### 5. Software Process Model
  
The software process model in developing the Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) project's student accommodation system is to create a user-friendly and high-quality system within the allotted time and budget which fulfils our stakeholders' requirements. Therefore, we have decided to employ the <b>Agile methodology</b> as our software development process model to accomplish our proposed system. This method focuses on cooperation and participation from stakeholders throughout the development process, creating a more adaptable and responsive system.

Furthermore, because of the nature of student rooms, development flexibility, and continuous team collaboration, the Agile methodology is perfect for projects like ours where requirements and priorities may change frequently. Agile methodology allows us to guarantee that the system is continually updated and enhanced depending on inputs from stakeholders while our project progress moves forward. This will enable the Student Accommodation System in the KTDI project to produce a system that always satisfies their changing needs and reaches expectations.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/proposal/submission/sec01/stakeholder/diagram/agile.PNG" width="500px" height="410px"></p>

Agile methodology for developing the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) as stated below:

1. _**Planning Phase:**_ The project scope, objectives and related stakeholders are identified. This will also include the timeline and milestones, identify risks, and allocate resources appropriately. The team develops a blueprint to foresee the final system and upcoming challenges. The Gantt chart is created so each member's project progress or task progress will always be on track and follow the timeline set. This phase only takes 1 week and will be lead by the project manager to control all the activities. 

2. _**Requirements Gathering Phase:**_ The project requirement analyst team works with the indentified stakeholders to identify and prioritise user requirements of student accommodation system. The team will develop user stories and create the product as backlog items. The team then identifies acceptance criteria for each user story and break down user stories into smaller tasks, which are then added to the sprint backlog. The project development team and the stakeholders then meet to review and finalise the sprint backlog to get a complete system requirements. This phase takes 1 week in order to carry out the interview session with the stakeholders and keep in touch with them for the latest requirements. The requirement analysis will in charge of the collection and documentation of requirements for the project.

3. _**Design Phase:**_ In this phase, the system designer and the main developer lead works with the development team to develop a high-level software architecture design of the system. The team identifies and designs the database schema, creates detailed design documents and develops wireframes and prototypes for the user interface. The design is then reviewed with the development team and the stakeholders and any necessary changes are made later. After this phase, the structure and the architecture of the system designed is developed clearly. It will take 2 weeks in this phase and the UI/UX system designer and the main developer take the vital role in giving out designed architecture and overseeing the progress schedule.

4. _**Development Phase:**_ The development team begins and collaborates to develop the software components according to the sprint backlog. The team conducts code reviews to ensure code quality, write unit tests and perform unit testing. Updating of code documentation and conducting daily stand-up meetings are nesscessary to discuss progress, address any issues or roadblocks as well as plan for the next day of work. This phase takes 4 weeks to implement and the tasks will be took charge by the developer team and the main developer will become the leader in carrying out the backend works, while fontend works will lead by the user interface or user experience designer. The proposed website for KTDI student accommodation system will be fully developed after this phase.

5. _**Testing Phase:**_ To make sure the software corresponds to specified standards, the development team has to develop a testing plan and carry out functional, integration and acceptability testing. Any flaws discovered during testing will be reported and fixed using a bug tracking programme to ensure that our software is of the greatest quality and meets the user requirements. This phase will take around 2 weeks because it is the most crucial phase for developing our system. The quality assurance analyst will take charge in managing these activities and a user required website with no technical errors will be successfully developed.

6. _**Deployment Phase:**_ Our project manager will collaborate with the development team during the deployment phase of our student accommodation system for Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) project to guarantee the programme is prepared for use. Final testing will be done to ensure the programme complies with all stakeholder criteria. To ensure the system runs smoothly, our team will train the stakeholders on how to use the programme and provide continuous support. We are aware of how crucial a successful deployment is and will collaborate closely with our project manager and software development team to make sure the move to the production environment goes smoothly. We estimate 2 weeks for the deployment as we need to make sure the system is fully stabilized and can run properly and it will be take charged by the project manager and the developers.
 
7. _**Review and maintenance phase:**_ The finished programme will be examined by the website developers and the stakeholders in the review phase part to make sure it really satisfies the acceptance criteria and user needs. To ensure that the final product meets the stakeholder's expectations, this phase requires ongoing stakeholder feedback. This feedback will assist the development team in both improving the system and ensuring that it satisfies the requirements of system users, resulting in a product of excellent quality. Review needs just 2 weeks because the team need to collect some of feedback from our stakeholders to know what the weaknesses or some problems towards our system. After receiving their feedbacks and comments, the maintenance team will start to solve the issues until it gets fully satisfactory from the users. This phase will let the IT support to guide the other team members to oversee the review and maintenance activities.

8. _**Launch Phase:**_ The launch phase displays the completed or finalised product that will be used in a real-world setting. Final testing and quality assurance will be carried out before the system software is launched by the project manager in collaboration with the development team to guarantee that the software is reliable and usable in a real-world setting. Following the software's deployment, on-going support will be offered to make sure the system keeps up with the demands and goals of the stakeholders. This will take just around 1 week to make sure all of it fulfill all of the stakeholders desires and to expose our final developed system to be used by our stakeholders. In this phase, all the members will be involved.

### 7. System Architecture
  
#### System Architecture Overview:
The proposed architecture for the student accommodation system project at Kolej Tun Dr Ismail will use a 3-Tier Architecture which consist of three layers: the presentation layer, the application layer and the data layer.
 
- Presentation Layer: <br>The presentation layer is the front-end of the system that users will interact with. It will consist of a web-based user interface built using the ReactJS as the font-end JavaScript library and designed by Bootstrap framework with HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as well as JavaScript. The presentation layer then will be responsible for presenting the data to the users and allowing them to interact with the well designed system in order to have a better user experience.
    
- Application Layer: <br>In this middle layer of the system, there are web server and server-side component which is the back-end of the system. Apache HTTP server will be used as the web server software to handle the HTTP requests and responses between the users and the web-based front-end via a browser. PHP server scripting language will be used on user requests handling, performing business logic and data processing as well as delivering the required data to the font-end system. It will be responsible for processing requests from the front-end and communicating with the data layer. We decided to use a server-side technology, PHP Laravel framework to help us to create extensible PHP-based web application with ease. It is also automated in testing and debugging errors in initial stage.
    
- Data Layer: <br>In this layer consists of the database system, we will use MySQL database management system to store and manage the data of user information and other related data. The data layer will be responsible for storing and retrieving data from the database.
    

#### Data Storage and Management:
MySQL will be used as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to store and manage the website data. All the data collected will be stored and organised in the form of a table representing a specific type of data, such as maintenance records, student records, room records and accommodation application records. 
  
#### Hardware and Software Requirements:
Hardware and software requirements are crucial components of our proposed system architecture. Managing the KTDI's student accommodation system's hardware and software requirements could be done as follows:

i. Hardware requirements 
- A computer with a processor of at least 2 GHz, which is good enough for web browsing.
-	A minimum of 16 GB RAM memory ensures extra speed and smooth functioning.
-	A minimum of 100 GB storage space to store the system files and database.
-	A screen with a resolution of at least 1920x1080 to display a sharper picture.
  
ii. Software requirements 
- ReactJS as the font-end JavaScript library for development of interactive website user interface.
- Bootstrap as the framework used for web application creation.
- MySQL as the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) to store and manage the data.
- Apache HTTP Server as the web server software.
- PHP Laravel framework as the server-side technology.
- GitHub for code hosting and version control.
- Google Cloud as a cloud hosting to store the documentation.
  
#### Data Analysis and Visualization:
- Data analysis tools: <br>We will use Microsoft Excel to clean and preprocess the data, perform statistical analysis and also create data models.
- Data visualisation tools: <br>We will use D3.js and Chart.js to create interactive charts and graph to visualise room type applicable based on hostel merit in a meaningful and attractive way.
- Business intelligence (BI) tools: <br>We will use Tableau, PowerBI to perform advanced analytics, create reports and generate insights from the data.

#### System Architecture Diagram:
- The proposed system architecture can be visualized using the following flowchart:

### 8. Risks Assessment
A project, programme, or organization's potential risks must be identified, evaluated, and prioritised as part of the risk assessment process. It is a crucial component of risk management, which seeks to reduce the likelihood and effect of prospective dangers. Both quantitative and qualitative ways of expressing the outcomes of this procedure are possible. To help minimise any potential risk-related repercussions, risk assessment is a necessary component of a larger risk management plan.

The risk assessments related to the Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) are:

- User adoption risk: 
  - User adoption and commitment are the keys to make the student accommodation system to be succeeded. The developed system will not provide the desired benefits if the target users, such as staff, admin, fellow and students are not using it efficiently. 

- Changes in project requirements:
  - Scope creep: As project requirements change over time, the project's scope will be extended, which could cause delays or the budget to be exceeded.
  - Incomplete or inaccurate specifications could lead to a poorly designed of web application system that doesn't satisfy the needs or expectations of the users.
  - Conflicts among the stakeholders: Stakeholders will have different ideas and needs, which can lead to conflicts that will cause the decision-making in the developing process to become slower.

- Resource Constraints:
  - Technical risk: <br>Technical problems faced by system development include hardware breakdowns, software glitches, and system outages, which can lead to system downtime, data loss, or system crashes.
  - Financial risk: <br>The Student Accommodation System in Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) needs a lot of money to implement and operate, and it's impossible to use the small income to cover those large amounts of costs.
 
To mitigate these risks, the following strategies will be employed for each risk:

- User adoption risk: 
  - Users can be trained and supported. The surveys and feedback sessions will be held to improve the Student Accomodation System in KTDI and incentives or rewards can be given to users who successfully adopt and use the system. These are all the actions that can help to reduce the risks associated with user adoption.

- Changes in project requirements:
  - The project requirements should be precisely stated, completed, and well-documented.
  - Create a changing management strategy that show details on how modifications to the project scope will be handled, including what will be documented, reviewed and approved.
  - To prevent conflicts, effectively communicate changes to the project's requirements to all audiences involved, including the project team and users. We must communicate effectively to discuss the project requirements so that conflicts will not be happened.

- Resource Constraints:
  - Technical risk: <br>Student Accommodation System in KTDI should put in place routine data backups and disaster recovery plans, as well as routine maintenance, software and hardware updates to reduce the technical risks. A qualified Information Technology specialist should be employed to run and support the maintenance of the system.
  - Financial risk: <br>To reduce financial risks,  the project manager should create a thorough financial strategy that takes into consideration the initial expenditures as well as recurring expenses of the proposed system. It's important to regularly examine and modify financial predictions to take any changes in enrollment or other monetary issues into consideration.

In general, it's necessary to identify and reduce these risks to ensure the Student Accommodation System in KTDI to be developed in more successful. We as the project team can reduce any negative effects and increase the advantages of the system by taking a proactive approach to risk management.

### 12. Conclusion

In conclusion, the proposed Student Accommodation System is a crucial solution to the challenges faced by Kolej Tun Dr Ismail (KTDI) in managing student housing operation and application. The system aims to improve data analysis, automate processes, give flexibility for students selecting their room, and provide a better user experience for students. The proposed system offers benefits such as increased student satisfaction, improved staff productivity, and a more reliable and efficient system.

This system will help to increase student satisfaction. By allowing the features of choosing students' own desired rooms through an user-friendly platform, the system will provide an easier way for students to customize their rooms that meet their needs. As a result, students will have a higher satistaction level towards the hostel application.

The method can also greatly increase employee productivity. The technology lessens the administrative load on staff members, allowing them to concentrate on more important responsibilities by automating procedures including room allocation, maintenance requests, and billing. In addition to saving time, this improved efficiency enables employees to offer students better support and assistance, raising KTDI's overall level of service.

The Student Accommodation System provides a housing management system that is more dependable and effective in addition to increasing staff productivity and student happiness. KTDI might learn important information about housing patterns, occupancy rates, and maintenance requirements with increased data analytic skills. Making educated judgements about resource allocation, capacity planning, and maintenance scheduling using this data will lead to a more efficient process.

The system's development and deployment may face difficulties, though, and this must be acknowledged. In order to guarantee the confidentiality and security of student information, data privacy issues must be addressed. When integrating the new system with the current processes and infrastructure, problems with system integration could also appear. However, by taking proactive measures to overcome these issues and cooperating as a team, the system's advantages may be realised and will ultimately surpass any early obstacles.

We encourage KTDI decision-makers to invest in this system to provide a more practical and efficient way of managing student housing, promoting academic success and overall well-being. The Student Accommodation System will help KTDI maintain its position as a leading accommodation college in UTM while improving the university's reputation. We look forward to working with KTDI to design and implement this system, enhancing the student experience and improving the operations of the KTDI itself.
