### 1. Executive Summary

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/235490755-87a5ad38-a137-4d46-85ba-0ab5a6b6a4c6.jpg" width="400" height=auto>


- Academic support services are crucial for students' academic success. However, traditional support methods such as office hours and group tutoring sessions can often be ineffective due to time constraints, lack of privacy, and disruption of class schedules. To overcome these limitations, the proposed solution is an academic support app that provides private appointments between students and lecturers at their convenience.

### 2. Background:

   The need for academic support services has become increasingly important in recent years as students face more challenges in their academic journeys. Many students struggle with academic performance due to various factors such as learning disabilities, time management issues, and lack of study skills. In response, academic institutions have developed support services to help students overcome these challenges and achieve academic success.

   However, traditional support methods such as office hours and group tutoring sessions have limitations that can hinder their effectiveness. For example, office hours may not be convenient for some students due to scheduling conflicts or lack of privacy. Group tutoring sessions may not provide the individualized attention some students need to succeed.

   The proposed academic support app addresses these limitations by providing private appointments between students and lecturers at their convenience. The app offers a more personalized and effective support system that can help students overcome the challenges they face and achieve academic success.
  
These are the current system interface from academic advisor view:

### 3. Objectives:
The objectives of this proposal are to:

1. Provide students with a more personalized and effective academic support system:
The objective is to enhance the academic support system by implementing an Academic Consultation System that caters to the individual needs of students. This system will enable students to schedule and attend one-on-one consultations with their lecturers, allowing for personalized guidance, feedback, and assistance. By offering a tailored support system, students will have the opportunity to address specific academic challenges, seek clarification on topics, and receive guidance to improve their understanding and performance.

2. Enable lecturers to provide individualized attention to students without disrupting their class schedule:
The objective is to empower lecturers to offer individualized attention and support to students without compromising their regular teaching responsibilities. The Academic Consultation System will facilitate appointment scheduling, allowing lecturers to allocate dedicated time slots for consultations. By managing consultations separately from class time, lecturers can focus on their teaching commitments while ensuring students receive the personalized attention they need outside the classroom. This objective aims to strike a balance between lecturers' availability and their commitment to students' academic growth.

3. Improve students' academic performance and engagement through one-on-one interactions with their lecturers:
The objective is to foster improved academic performance and engagement among students by facilitating meaningful one-on-one interactions with their lecturers. The Academic Consultation System will enable students to have dedicated consultations, where they can address specific concerns, receive guidance on assignments and projects, and gain a deeper understanding of course material. By providing this personalized attention, students are likely to experience increased motivation, higher levels of engagement, and improved academic outcomes, leading to overall academic success.

These objectives collectively aim to enhance the academic support system, prioritize individualized attention, and promote student success through effective one-on-one interactions between students and lecturers.

### 4. Scope: 

The Academic Support Services System will provide a web-based platform that allows students to book appointments with their lecturers for academic support services. The system will include the following features:

- Student and lecturer registration and login.
- Appointment scheduling and management.
- Communication and messaging between students and lecturers.
- Notifications and reminders for both academic advisors and students.
- Analytics and reporting for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the system.
- The system will be limited to academic support services only and will not provide any additional features such as course content or assessment tools.

### 5. Software Process Model:

   The ideal software process model for this project is the Agile methodology. The Agile methodology is ideal for this project because it allows for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements. This is important because the system will be continuously improved based on feedback from students and lecturers.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128196055/235509164-0d5157b4-b28e-46a5-b02a-db9fd7601fa3.jpg" width="400" height=auto>
<img src="https://github.com/drshahizan/software-engineering/blob/main/proposal/submission/sec02/program/usecasediagram%20(2).png"width="800" height=auto>

The Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on delivering working software frequently. The methodology is based on four core values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

The Agile methodology consists of several phases, including planning, requirements analysis, design, development, testing, and deployment. The phases overlap and are conducted in short iterations, typically lasting two to four weeks. The Agile methodology is well-suited for this project because it allows for continuous improvement and flexibility.

Activities for each phase of the Agile methodology:

- Planning: Define project scope, establish project team, create product backlog.
- Requirements Analysis: Gather user requirements, create user stories, prioritize user stories.
- Design: Create wireframes, design database schema, create UI mockups.
- Development: Implement features, conduct code reviews, conduct unit tests.
- Testing: Conduct integration testing, conduct acceptance testing, resolve defects.
- Deployment: Deploy software to production, train users, provide support.

### 6. Budget:
