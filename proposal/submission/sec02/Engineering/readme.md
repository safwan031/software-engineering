### 1. Executive Summary:

The parcel delivery management system for a One Stop Parcel System of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia is a web-based application that will provide a streamlined and user-friendly interface for students, faculty, and staff to send and receive parcels on campus. The system will include real-time tracking of parcel deliveries, integration with the university's existing student and faculty database, secure payment processing for parcel deliveries, and a notification system to inform users when a parcel has arrived. The system will also integrate with the university's existing security system for parcel pickup.

The project timeline for the parcel system is estimated at 14 weeks, including requirements gathering and analysis, system design and development, and system deployment and training. 

The proposed parcel delivery management system will provide numerous benefits to the university community, including improved delivery times, enhanced security for parcel pickup, and a more efficient and user-friendly parcel delivery process. The project is expected to be successful, with careful planning, attention to detail, and effective communication and collaboration among the development team and stakeholders. Student who do parcel delivery service will also benefit from increased efficiency, as the system will reduce the need for messaging and waiting. Finally, the system is expected to reduce errors and delays in the parcel delivery process, resulting in a more reliable and efficient system overall.

### 2. Background:

Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) have large campuses with many buildings and locations, which can make it challenging for UTM students, faculty, and staff to send and receive parcels efficiently. In addition, traditional parcel delivery methods require individuals to wait in long lines or travel to Kolej Rahman Putra which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Traditional parcel delivery method require students to place or recieve order in Telegram group which make students to overlook the thousand of messages and wait for too long to accpet their delivery orders.

To address these challenges, a parcel system can be implemented to streamline the parcel delivery process and provide a more user-friendly experience for students, faculty, and staff. The proposed parcel system will be a web-based application that will be accessible to all members of the university community, allowing them to easily send and receive parcels on campus.

The system will integrate with the university's existing student and faculty database, providing a seamless and secure user experience. The system will also include real-time tracking of parcel deliveries, which will allow users to monitor the status of their parcels and receive updates on delivery times.

Overall, the proposed parcel system is expected to provide numerous benefits to the university community, including improved delivery times, enhanced security for parcel pickup, and a more efficient and user-friendly parcel delivery process.

3. Software Development Tools: Utilizing software development tools such as Git can be helpful in streamlining the development process and ensuring code quality.



### 10. Technical Specifications:
  
1. **Hardware Requirements:**

  - A reliable server or cloud hosting service capable of handling a large volume of traffic
  - Sufficient storage space for storing user data, package information, and payment details
  - A backup and disaster recovery solution to ensure that data is not lost in the event of a system failure or outage
  - A network infrastructure capable of supporting the system's traffic and data transfer needs
  - Hardware devices such as scanners or printers may also be required for package tracking and label printing

2. **Software Requirements:**

  - A server-side programming language such as PHP, or HTML for building the back-end of the system
  - A database management system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server for storing system data
  - A version control system such as Git for managing code changes and collaboration among the development team


  3. **Data security measures that will be implemented.**
  
  - Secure authentication: The system should implement secure authentication measures to ensure that only authorized users have access to the system. This can include measures such as multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, and session timeouts.

- Encryption: All sensitive data such as user information, payment details, and package information should be encrypted both at rest and in transit. This can be achieved using encryption protocols such as SSL or TLS.

- Firewall protection: The system should be protected by firewalls to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Firewalls can be configured to allow only authorized traffic to the system and to block potentially malicious traffic.

- Regular security audits: Regular security audits should be conducted to identify and address any vulnerabilities or security weaknesses in the system. Audits can be conducted by internal or external security experts and should be conducted on a regular basis to ensure that the system remains secure.

- Role-based access control: The system should implement role-based access control to ensure that users have access only to the data and functionality that they need to perform their roles. This can help to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and minimize the impact of any security breaches.

- Backup and disaster recovery: A backup and disaster recovery plan should be implemented to ensure that data is not lost in the event of a system failure or outage. Regular backups should be taken and stored in a secure location to ensure that data can be restored in the event of a disaster.

- Regular software updates: Regular software updates should be implemented to ensure that the system is protected against known vulnerabilities and security threats. Updates should be tested thoroughly before being deployed to ensure that they do not break any functionality or compromise data security.

 4. **Data sources:**
  The parcel delivery system will require data from various sources, including user data, package information, and payment details. User data may be sourced from the university's student and staff databases, while package information may be sourced from the courier or delivery services used by the university. Payment details may be sourced from payment gateways used by the system.

5. **Data schema:**
  The data schema is the structure of the database that stores the system's data. The data schema should be designed to be efficient and secure, and should be able to handle a large volume of data. The schema should include tables for storing user data, package information, and payment details, as well as any other data required by the system.

6. **Data transformations:**
  Data transformations may be necessary to ensure that data is stored and processed correctly in the system. For example, data may need to be transformed to conform to a specific format or standard, or to remove any errors or inconsistencies in the data. Data transformations may be performed using tools such as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or data mapping software.
