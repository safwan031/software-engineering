<p><b>The HyperText Markup Language</b> or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

<p>HTML elements are the <small>building blocks</small> of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a <u>means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,</u> quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<p><mark>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</mark> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former <del>maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS</del> standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<sup>[2]</sup> A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, together with JavaScript.</p>
