# Lab 6: HTML Table
In HTML, a table is a way of presenting data in rows and columns. A table can be used to display various types of information in a structured and organized manner.

The basic structure of an HTML table consists of three main elements: the table itself (`<table>`), the rows within the table (`<tr>`), and the cells within the rows (`<td>`).

To create a table, you begin by using the `<table>` tag to define the table. Within the table, you then create one or more rows using the `<tr>` tag. Each row is made up of one or more cells, which are defined using the `<td>` tag. For example, here's a simple table with two rows and two columns:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
This code creates a table with two rows and two columns. Each cell contains some text. The resulting table will look like this:

| Row 1, Column 1 | Row 1, Column 2 |
| ----- | ----- |
| Row 2, Column 1 | Row 2, Column 2 |

You can also use various attributes with the table, row, and cell tags to control the appearance of the table, such as "border" to add a border around the table or "colspan" and "rowspan" to span a cell across multiple rows or columns. Additionally, you can use the `<th>` tag instead of `<td>` to define header cells, which are typically bold and centered in the table.

HTML tables are a powerful way to present complex data in a structured and easy-to-read format. By properly structuring your tables and using appropriate attributes and tags, you can create effective and visually appealing tables for your webpages.
