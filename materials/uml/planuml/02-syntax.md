# Syntax
PlantUML provides a simple and intuitive syntax for creating UML diagrams. The syntax is based on a text-based markup language that allows you to describe the various elements of a UML diagram using a series of keywords, symbols, and characters.

To create a UML diagram using PlantUML, you start by specifying the type of diagram you want to create (e.g. "class", "sequence", "usecase", etc.) using a keyword. You then use a combination of symbols and characters to define the various elements of the diagram.

| No. | Name| Description|
| --- | -----------------| ----------------------------------|
| 1| [Sequence diagram](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram) | Depicts interactions between objects over time. |
| 2| [Use case diagram](https://plantuml.com/use-case-diagram) | Shows the relationships between actors and use cases in a system.|
| 3| [Class diagram](https://plantuml.com/class-diagram) | Describes the structure of classes and their relationships.|
| 4| [Object diagram](https://plantuml.com/object-diagram)| Shows a snapshot of objects and their relationships at a particular point in time. |
| 5| [Activity diagram](https://plantuml.com/activity-diagram-beta) | Illustrates the flow of activities in a system.|
| 6| [Component diagram](https://plantuml.com/component-diagram)| Illustrates the structure of components and their relationships.|
| 7| [Deployment diagram](https://plantuml.com/deployment-diagram)| Shows the physical deployment of components in a system.|
| 8| [State diagram](https://plantuml.com/state-diagram) | Describes the behavior of objects in response to events.|
| 9| [Timing diagram](https://plantuml.com/timing-diagram)| Shows the timing constraints of interactions between objects.|
