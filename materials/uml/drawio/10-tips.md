Collaborating with others in Draw.io is a powerful feature that enables multiple people to work on the same diagram at the same time. One popular way to collaborate on diagrams in Draw.io is to use a version control system, such as GitHub, to store the diagram file.

## Insert a page in Draw.io
To insert a page in Draw.io for UML diagram, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Draw.io and create a new blank diagram.

2. Click on the "Page" option in the toolbar at the top of the screen.

3. Select "Add Page" from the drop-down menu.

4. Enter a name for the new page, such as "UML Diagram for Course Registration System".

5. Select the UML template that you want to use for your diagram.

6. Click "Create" to add the new page to your diagram.

Now, you can start designing your UML diagram for the university academic course registration system on the new page that you just created. 

Using pages in Draw.io for UML diagram can be very useful as it allows you to organize your diagrams better and keep related diagrams together in a single file. This can help to improve the overall clarity of your UML diagram and make it easier for you to navigate between different parts of your design.

For example, for a university academic course registration system, you might create separate pages for different parts of the system, such as the student registration process, the course management process, and the payment processing process. You can then link these pages together using hyperlinks or other connectors to create a complete and comprehensive UML diagram for the entire system.

## Collaborate with others
Here are the steps to collaborate with others in Draw.io using GitHub:

1. Create a new diagram in Draw.io or open an existing one.
2. Click on File > Export As > GitHub. 
3. If you have not already done so, authorize Draw.io to access your GitHub account.
4. Select the repository where you want to store your diagram file, and enter a file name and description.
5. Click "Export." Draw.io will create a new file in your selected repository.
6. Share the link to the GitHub file with your collaborators.

Once you have shared the link to the GitHub file with your collaborators, they can make changes to the diagram file and push their changes to the repository. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Your collaborators can open the diagram file in Draw.io by clicking the link to the GitHub file that you shared with them.
2. They can make changes to the diagram file in Draw.io.
3. After making changes, they can click on File > Save to GitHub. 
4. Draw.io will prompt them to enter a commit message and description for their changes.
5. After entering a commit message and description, they can click "Save."
6. The changes will be pushed to the repository and saved in the diagram file.

Using GitHub to collaborate on Draw.io diagrams has several advantages. First, it provides a version control system that allows collaborators to track changes and revert to earlier versions if necessary. Second, it enables real-time collaboration, as multiple people can work on the same diagram file simultaneously. Finally, it provides a centralized location for storing and sharing diagram files, making it easier to collaborate with others and share your work.

In addition to GitHub, Draw.io also supports collaboration using other cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, OneDrive, and Dropbox. Regardless of the platform you use, collaborating with others in Draw.io can help you create more effective diagrams that are well-organized and easy to understand.
