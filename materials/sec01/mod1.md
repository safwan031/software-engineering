## Software Complexity

Software complexity is a natural byproduct of the functional complexity that the code is attempting to enable. With multiple system interfaces and complex requirements, the complexity of software systems sometimes grows beyond control, rendering applications and portfolios overly costly to maintain and risky to enhance. The software complexity are come from:

- Application domain: Application domain refers to the specific area of application or field in which a software system is designed to operate. It encompasses the knowledge, concepts, and terminology that are relevant to a particular application area, as well as the constraints and requirements that are specific to that domain.

- Communication among stakeholders (clients, developers): Effective communication between domain experts and developers is crucial for the success of software projects. Domain experts have deep knowledge of the application domain, including its terminology, concepts, and requirements. Developers, on the other hand, have expertise in software development, including programming languages, software design, and testing.

- Management of large software development projects: Management of large software development projects is a complex task that requires careful planning, effective communication, and efficient use of resources. The key strategies that can be used to manage large software development projects are develop a detailed project plan, break down the project into smaller tasks, define clear roles and responsibilities, use project management tools and monitor project risks. 

Software complexity can lead to software quality problems. The reason that lead to these problems are:

- Increased likelihood of defects: As software becomes more complex, the likelihood of defects increases. This is because there are more opportunities for errors to occur, and it becomes more difficult to ensure that all possible scenarios have been tested. As a result, complex software may be more likely to contain bugs or other defects that can impact its quality.

- Difficulty in understanding and maintaining the code: Complex software can be difficult to understand and maintain, which can lead to quality problems. Developers may struggle to identify bugs or make changes to the code, leading to errors and defects. This can be particularly problematic when multiple developers are working on the same codebase, as inconsistencies and conflicts can arise.

- Poor performance: Complex software can also suffer from poor performance, as it may require more processing power or memory to run effectively. This can lead to crashes or other quality problems that impact the user experience.

- Inconsistencies in user experience: Complex software can also lead to inconsistencies in the user experience, as different parts of the software may behave differently or have different design patterns. This can lead to confusion and frustration among users, which can impact their perception of the software's quality.

Here are some of the examples of software quality problems that have occurred around the world:

- Y2K Bug: In the late 1990s, there was concern that many computer systems would experience problems when the year 2000 arrived, due to the way dates were stored. This was known as the Y2K bug, and many organizations spent significant time and resources updating their software to prevent problems.

- Ariane 5 Rocket Failure: In 1996, the maiden flight of the Ariane 5 rocket ended in failure due to a software error. The rocket's software was not designed to handle the faster speed of the new rocket, leading to a crash that destroyed the rocket and its payload.

- Volkswagen Emissions Scandal: In 2015, it was discovered that Volkswagen had installed software in its diesel cars that allowed them to cheat emissions tests. This led to a scandal that affected millions of cars around the world, and caused significant damage to Volkswagen's reputation.
- 
- Healthcare.gov Launch Issues: In 2013, the launch of the Healthcare.gov website in the United States was marred by numerous software quality problems. The website was slow, buggy, and difficult to use, which led to significant criticism and delays in the enrollment process.

Overall, software complexity can have a significant impact on software quality. To mitigate these issues, developers should focus on simplifying the software design, reducing the number of components, and thoroughly testing the software to identify and fix defects before release. Additionally, they should prioritize effective communication and collaboration among team members, to ensure that everyone is on the same page and working towards the same goals.

## Software Changeability

Software changeability refers to the ease with which modifications can be made to a software system. In other words, it refers to the ability of software to adapt to changes and evolve over time. Changeability is an important factor in software development as it can affect the maintenance, scalability, and overall quality of the software.

The changeability of a software system is influenced by various factors, such as the design of the system, the programming language used, the tools and techniques employed, and the level of documentation and testing. A well-designed software system that is modular and loosely coupled can be more changeable as changes to one component will have minimal impact on the others. Similarly, using a programming language that supports features such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction can make the software more adaptable to changes.

To improve the changeability of a software system, it is important to follow best practices such as writing clean code, using version control systems, writing automated tests, and documenting the code. By doing so, developers can make it easier to understand, modify, and maintain the software over time, which can ultimately lead to a more robust and reliable system.

## Computer Science vs.Software Engineering

Computer science and software engineering may share some overlapping commonalities, however, the principles behind each field can offer several differences. One is that computer science deals with the science behind the interaction between hardware and software systems and computational applications, whereas software engineering typically deals with the engineering principles of building, designing and testing software products.The differences of computer science and software engineering are:

- Core educational studies: Computer science and software engineering may share some overlapping core studies, however, when studying computer science students may typically complete courses that focus on the computing, analysis, storage and application of data and data systems of computer programs and software. Computer science education program focuses on the science behind making computers work, while software engineering applies those scientific and mathematical principles to the building, designing and implementation of hardware and software programs.

- Career paths: Generally, computer science degrees may offer candidates a broad range of job options in the informational technology industry, from computer programming for website design and working in IT support roles to working as a game developer. Conversely, a degree in software engineering can narrow a candidate's career path to specialized roles in corporations, companies and even mid-sized businesses developing and building applications and software programs.

- Hardware and software interaction: Computer science may deal with the interaction between software programs with computer hardware. For instance, a computer scientist might determine ways to create software programs that are compatible with computer hardware. A software engineer, however, deals only with software programs, specifically creating, maintaining, testing and producing software products.

- Programming and development: Computer science will focus on computing and calculating the best ways to program software as well as finding calculations that allow engineers and developers to build software programs that meet product requirements. Software engineers essentially use the analysis and outlines from computer scientists to aid in the full development and construction of new frameworks and software programs.

- Software design: When approaching software design, a computer scientist may typically work with theories and algorithms for how a program works, how it may be best designed and how to apply programming languages to the application. When software engineers work with software design, they may use a computer scientist's information and analyses to design the framework to build a specific program.

-  Scientific theories: Computer science is also different from software engineering because it focuses heavily on scientific theories behind computer operations, computing and data systems as well as how software is designed. Software engineering, however, can use these theories to aid in the design and processes of building frameworks, software programs and applications. So while computer science studies and develops theories behind computer operations, software engineering applies these theories to build real-world computer applications.

- Computer coding: Computer science and software engineering may both focus on computer coding and languages, however, software engineering may focus more heavily on learning coding to use it when developing and building software. A computer scientist may focus on coding as it relates to computer languages, and they may also use various computer coding to calculate compatibility between hardware and software applications.

In summary, computer science is the study of computing and computational systems, while software engineering is the practical application of computer science principles to software development.Both are the best in their own aspects. However, you should optional for the Software engineering if you are interested in software testing, software development and overall software life cycle or you can optional for Computer Science if you have an interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, security, database management, etc.

However, in general, software quality should always be a top priority, as it has a significant impact on the success of a software product and the overall reputation of the organization.

Here are some factors that can influence the priority of software quality:

- Customer requirements: The quality of the software should meet or exceed the customer's requirements and expectations. If the customer requires a high-quality software product, then the priority of software quality should be high.

- Time-to-market: If a software product needs to be released quickly to meet market demand or competition, then the priority of software quality may be lower. However, this should not compromise the software's functional or performance requirements.

- Cost: The priority of software quality may be affected by the project's budget. If there are limited resources, the focus may be on meeting the minimum requirements while ensuring the software is reliable and maintainable.

- Criticality of the software: If the software product is critical to the organization's operations or safety, then the priority of software quality should be high. For example, software used in healthcare, aviation, or finance must meet strict quality standards to ensure safety and reliability.

- Technical complexity: If the software product is complex, with many components or integration points, then the priority of software quality should be high. Complex software requires more testing and verification to ensure that it operates correctly.

In summary, software quality should always be a priority, but the level of priority may vary depending on the specific project's requirements, time-to-market, budget, criticality, and technical complexity. The ultimate goal should always be to deliver a high-quality software product that meets or exceeds customer expectations, is reliable, scalable, and maintainable over the long term.

## Software Standard and Document

Software standards are a set of guidelines or criteria that describe best practices for the development, design, and maintenance of software. These standards are typically developed by professional organizations or regulatory bodies to ensure consistency and quality across software products.

There are various types of software standards, including coding standards, testing standards, and documentation standards. Coding standards define the rules and conventions for writing source code, while testing standards specify the procedures and techniques for testing software. Documentation standards dictate the format and content of documents produced during the software development process, such as design documents, user manuals, and technical specifications.

Software documentation is an important part of the software development process. It involves creating and maintaining various types of documents that describe the software's design, functionality, and operation. Documentation can include user manuals, technical specifications, design documents, code comments, and help files.

The purpose of software documentation is to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the software to users, developers, and other stakeholders. Good documentation can help to reduce errors, improve maintainability, and facilitate collaboration among team members. It can also help to ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.

Overall, software standards and documentation are essential components of the software development process. By following established standards and producing high-quality documentation, software developers can improve the quality, reliability, and usability of their products.
