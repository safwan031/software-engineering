# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Online Grading System

## Developing an academic grading system for a university requires some steps to follow to develop an academic grading system for a university:

### 1. Define the Requirements:
Start by defining the requirements of the grading system, including the grading criteria, the grading scale, and the grading policies. The system should also capture other relevant information such as student name, course name, semester, and instructor name.

### 2. Design the System Architecture: 
Once you have defined the requirements, you can start designing the system architecture. Determine the technology stack and the database schema that will be used to build the system. You may also consider whether to use a cloud-based system or an on-premise system.

### 3. Develop the System: 
After defining the requirements and system architecture, you can start developing the system. Start with building the core functionality of the registration system and then move on to the user interface. Ensure that the system is secure and scalable.

### 4. Test and Debug: 
Once the system is developed, it is important to thoroughly test and debug it. Conduct various types of testing such as functional testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure that the system meets the requirements and is error-free.

### 5. Deploy the System: 
Once testing is complete, deploy the system to the production environment. Ensure that the system is backed up regularly and that appropriate security measures are in place to protect student data.

### 6. Maintain and Update the System: 
Finally, maintain and update the system as necessary to ensure that it remains functional and up-to-date with changing requirements and technologies.

#### In addition 
consider incorporating the following features into the academic grading system:

Gradebook: a feature that allows instructors to enter grades and track student progress.
Automatic Calculations: a feature that automatically calculates grades based on the grading criteria and policies.
Reports: a feature that generates reports for students, instructors, and administrators to review grades and student progress.
By following these steps and incorporating these features, you can develop an academic grading system for a university that meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff while ensuring the security and integrity of student data.

## Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, analyzing, documenting, validating, and managing the requirements of a software system or product. It ensures that the software meets the needs of its stakeholders and provides a solid foundation for the development team to build the system.

The requirements engineering process for an academic grading system typically involves the following steps:

### 1. Requirements Elicitation: 
The first step is to identify the stakeholders who will be affected by the academic grading system and gather their requirements. This involves conducting interviews, surveys, and focus groups with students, faculty, administrators, and other relevant parties to determine their needs, preferences, and expectations.

### 2. Requirements Analysis: 
Once the requirements have been gathered, they need to be analyzed and prioritized. This involves identifying any conflicts or contradictions in the requirements and resolving them. The requirements should also be categorized based on their importance and feasibility.

### 3. Requirements Specification: 
The next step is to document the requirements in a clear and concise manner. This involves creating use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, and other documentation that will serve as the basis for the system design.

### 4. Requirements Validation: 
Once the requirements have been specified, they need to be validated to ensure that they are complete, accurate, and consistent. This involves reviewing the requirements with stakeholders and conducting prototyping and testing to ensure that they meet the needs of the users.

### 5. Requirements Management: 
The final step is to manage the requirements throughout the development process. This involves tracking changes to the requirements, maintaining traceability between the requirements and the system design, and ensuring that the requirements are met in the final product.

Overall, the requirements engineering process for an academic grading system is critical to ensure that the system meets the needs of its users, is reliable, and meets the expectations of all stakeholders. By following a structured approach to requirements engineering, the academic grading system can be designed and developed to achieve the desired outcomes.

## Stakeholders

The stakeholders in an academic grading system may include:

### 1. Students: 
The primary stakeholders in the academic grading system are the students who receive the grades. They have a vested interest in the accuracy, fairness, and transparency of the grading system.

### 2. Faculty: 
The faculty members who teach the courses and assign grades are also stakeholders in the grading system. They need a system that is easy to use and that accurately reflects student performance.

### 3. Administrators: 
University administrators, such as deans, department heads, and registrars, are also stakeholders in the grading system. They require access to student grades for a variety of purposes, such as accreditation and student retention.

### 4. Employers: 
Employers who hire graduates may also be stakeholders in the grading system. They may look at grades as an indicator of a student's knowledge, skills, and abilities.

### 5. Parents: 
Parents of students may also be stakeholders in the grading system. They may want to be informed about their child's academic progress and require access to the grading system.

### 6. Accrediting bodies: 
Accrediting bodies may also be stakeholders in the grading system. They may require access to student grades to assess the quality of education provided by the institution.

Overall, the stakeholders in an academic grading system are diverse, and the grading system must meet the needs and expectations of all stakeholders to ensure its success.

## Use Cases

Use cases are a common technique used in software development to describe how users interact with a system to achieve specific goals. Here are some examples of use cases for an academic grading system:

### 1. Viewing grades: 
A student can view their grades for a particular course or semester.

### 2. Entering grades: 
An instructor can enter grades for assignments, exams, and other assessments.

### 3. Updating grades: 
An instructor can update grades if there was an error or if a student submitted a late assignment.

### 4. Calculating grades: 
The academic grading system can automatically calculate the final grade for a course based on the weightings of different assessments.

### 5. Assigning grades: 
The academic grading system can automatically assign a letter grade or a grade point average (GPA) based on the final grade.

### 6. Monitoring progress: 
An advisor or academic dean can monitor a student's progress and identify potential issues, such as low grades or incomplete assignments.

### 7. Notifying students: 
The academic grading system can automatically notify students of their grades via email or other channels.

### 8. Generating reports: 
The academic grading system can generate reports for instructors, advisors, and academic administrators, such as grade reports or progress reports.

### 9. Handling grade disputes: 
The academic grading system can provide a mechanism for handling grade disputes, such as allowing students to contest a grade or allowing instructors to explain their grading decisions.

By identifying and describing these use cases, you can ensure that the academic grading system meets the needs and expectations of its users, and that it is designed to support their goals and workflows.
