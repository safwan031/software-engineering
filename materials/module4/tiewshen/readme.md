# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student attendance management system
## Key steps in creating student attendance management system:

### 1. Define the scope:</b><br>
Start by defining the scope of the system. What types of attendance do you want to track (e.g., class attendance, event attendance, lab attendance)? What types of reports do you want to generate? What are the key features you want to include in the system?

### 2. Design the system architecture:</b><br> 
Once you have defined the scope of the system, you can start designing the system architecture. This will involve deciding on the programming language, database system, and other tools you will use to build the system.

### 3. Develop the student database:</b> <br>
The first step in building the system is to develop a student database. This database should include information such as student names, student IDs, and class schedules.

### 4. Implement the attendance tracking system:</b> <br>
Once you have developed the student database, you can start implementing the attendance tracking system. This system should allow teachers to mark attendance for each student in their classes. It should also allow students to view their own attendance records.

### 5. Generate reports:</b> <br>
Once the attendance data has been collected, the system should be able to generate reports. Reports can be used to track attendance trends over time, identify students who are frequently absent, and monitor attendance rates for specific classes or events.

### 6. Add analysis tools:</b> <br>
In addition to reports, the system should include analysis tools. These tools can be used to identify patterns in attendance data, such as which classes have the highest attendance rates or which students are most likely to be absent.

### 7. Test and refine the system:</b> <br>
After the system has been developed, it should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it is functioning as expected. Any bugs or issues should be addressed, and the system should be refined based on feedback from users.

### 8. Deploy the system:</b> <br>
Once the system has been tested and refined, it can be deployed to the university. Training should be provided to teachers and students to ensure that they understand how to use the system.

## Requirement Engineering
Requirement engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the requirements of a software system. The goal of requirement engineering is to ensure that the software system meets the needs of its stakeholders and delivers the desired functionality.

The following are the key activities involved in requirement engineering:

### Eliciting requirements: 
The first step in requirement engineering is to elicit requirements from stakeholders, such as customers, users, and domain experts. This can be done through various techniques, such as interviews, surveys, and workshops.

### Analyzing requirements: 
Once the requirements have been elicited, they need to be analyzed to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. This can involve breaking down the requirements into smaller, more manageable parts, and identifying any conflicts or inconsistencies.

### Specifying requirements: 
The next step is to specify the requirements in a clear and precise manner. This involves documenting the requirements in a format that can be easily understood by all stakeholders. Common formats for specifying requirements include use cases, user stories, and functional requirements.

### Validating requirements: 
After the requirements have been specified, they need to be validated to ensure that they meet the needs of stakeholders. This can be done through various techniques, such as reviews, inspections, and testing.

### Managing requirements: 
Finally, the requirements need to be managed throughout the software development process. This involves tracking changes to the requirements, managing conflicts, and ensuring that the requirements are being met as the software is being developed.

The importance of requirement engineering cannot be overstated. It helps ensure that the software system meets the needs of its stakeholders, and that the development process is more efficient and effective. A thorough and well-executed requirement engineering process can lead to a successful software system that meets the needs of its stakeholders and delivers the desired functionality.

## Stakeholders
Stakeholders in a student attendance management system can be broadly classified into three categories:

### 1. Primary stakeholders: 
These are the stakeholders who are directly impacted by the system, and they include:
Students: They are the end-users of the system and can view their own attendance records and receive notifications about their attendance.

### 2. Teachers: 
They can mark attendance for their classes, monitor student attendance, and generate reports.

### 3. Administrative staff: 
They can use the system to manage attendance records, generate reports, and track attendance trends.

### 4. Secondary stakeholders: 
These are the stakeholders who are indirectly impacted by the system, and they include:
### 5. Parents: 
They can view their children's attendance records and receive notifications about their attendance.

### 6. Management: 
They can use the system to monitor attendance rates across different classes, events, or departments and make decisions based on attendance data.

### 7. Tertiary stakeholders: 
These are the stakeholders who provide input or support to the system, and they include:
### 8. IT department: 
They can provide technical support for the system and ensure that it is running smoothly.

### 9. System developers: 
They are responsible for developing and maintaining the system.

### 10. Regulators: 
They may have certain requirements or regulations that need to be followed by the system.

It is important to identify all stakeholders in the system and consider their needs and requirements during the development and implementation process. This ensures that the system meets the needs of all stakeholders and is more likely to be adopted and used effectively.

## Users and system requirements
Users and system requirements are two different aspects of an academic course registration system, and it is important to understand the differences between them.

### User requirements
Users refer to the people who will be using the system, including students, faculty members, and university administrators. They have specific needs, preferences, and expectations from the system, and their requirements are often expressed in terms of user stories, scenarios, or use cases. For example, a student may require the ability to search for courses by department, instructor, or time of day, while a faculty member may require the ability to view student transcripts or communicate with their class via email.

### System requirements
System requirements, on the other hand, refer to the technical and functional specifications of the system. They describe what the system must do, and are often expressed in terms of features, capabilities, and constraints. For example, the system may need to be able to handle a certain number of concurrent users, have robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and integrate with other university systems such as the student information system or the learning management system.

While user requirements and system requirements are distinct, they are closely related, and it is important to ensure that they are aligned. The system requirements should be designed to meet the needs and expectations of the system's users, and the user requirements should be prioritized and translated into specific system requirements. By understanding both users and system requirements, designers and developers can create a course registration system that meets the needs of its stakeholders while being technically sound and reliable.

## User requirements in student attendance management system

User requirements for a student attendance management system can include the following:

### 1. User-friendly interface: 
The system should have a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate for all users, including teachers, students, and administrators.

### 2. Attendance tracking: 
The system should allow teachers to mark attendance easily and accurately for each class, and students should be able to view their own attendance records.

### 3.Notifications:
The system should send notifications to students and parents about their attendance, such as when they are absent or when their attendance is below a certain threshold.

### 4. Reporting:
The system should generate reports on attendance data, such as attendance rates for specific classes, events, or departments.

### 5. Access control: 
The system should have appropriate access controls to ensure that only authorized users can view or modify attendance data.

### 6. Integration with other systems: 
The system should integrate with other systems, such as student information systems and learning management systems.

### 7. Mobile compatibility:
The system should be compatible with mobile devices, allowing users to access the system from anywhere and at any time.

### 8. Customization: 
The system should allow for customization, such as setting up different attendance policies for different classes or departments.

### 9. Support: 
The system should provide adequate support to users, such as help documentation and customer service.

By identifying these user requirements, developers can design and build a student attendance management system that meets the needs of all stakeholders and delivers the desired functionality.
