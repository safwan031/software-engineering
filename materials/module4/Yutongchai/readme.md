# Software Requirements Document (SRD): University Social Network System
A university social networking system is a platform designed to facilitate communication and collaboration among students, faculty, and staff within a university community. It allows users to create profiles, share information, participate in discussions, join interest groups, and connect with other members of the university community.

University social networking systems can provide a variety of features, including messaging, file sharing, event management, and course collaboration tools. They can be accessed through both desktop and mobile devices, providing users with the flexibility to stay connected and engaged with their university community anytime, anywhere.

Overall, a university social networking system can enhance the sense of community and foster a collaborative and supportive environment for learning and growth.

<b>3. Design: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the technical and functional specifications of the system are developed. This involves creating the architecture, user interface, and database design of the system.

<b>4. Development: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the software code of the system is written, tested, and deployed. This involves following the design specifications and coding standards to build a reliable and efficient system.

<b>5. Testing:</b>
<br>
In this stage, the system is thoroughly tested for functionality, usability, and performance. This involves conducting unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to ensure that the system works as expected.

<b>6. Deployment: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the system is installed and made available to the users. This involves configuring the servers, installing the software, and providing user training and support.

<b>7. Maintenance: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the system is regularly monitored and maintained to ensure that it continues to function optimally. This involves fixing bugs, applying security patches, and updating the software to keep it up-to-date.

## Requirements Engineering
The Requirements Engineering process of a University Social Network system involves the following steps:

<b>1. Requirements elicitation: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements of the system are identified by gathering information from stakeholders, users, and other sources.

<b>2. Requirements analysis: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements are analyzed to determine their feasibility, consistency, and completeness. This involves prioritizing the requirements, identifying conflicts, and resolving ambiguities.

<b>3. Requirements specification: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements are documented in a clear and concise manner. This involves creating use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, and other documents to describe the system requirements.

<b>4. Requirements validation: </b>
<br>
In this stage, the requirements are reviewed and validated to ensure that they meet the needs of the stakeholders and users. This involves conducting walkthroughs, inspections, and tests to verify the requirements.
