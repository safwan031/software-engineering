# Module 4: Requirements Engineering

This module focuses on the process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing software requirements for a case study on an academic course registration system. Specifically, the module aims to guide students in creating an IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) for the system.

| No | Part | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [Requirements Engineering Introduction](p1-intro.md) | Introduction to the process of requirements engineering and its importance in software development. Discusses different stakeholders involved in the process and their roles and responsibilities. |
| 2 | [Functional Requirements](p2-functional.md) | Focuses on the functional requirements of an academic course registration system, including capabilities and behavior. |
| 3 | [Requirements Specification](p3-soft-requirement.md) | Guidelines for creating an IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) for the academic course registration system, including structure and types of requirements to include. |
| 4 | [Form Based Specifications](p4-form.md) | Focuses on the use of form-based methods to capture software requirements for the academic course registration system. Discusses benefits of using forms and best practices for designing effective forms. |
| 5 | [Advance Requirements Engineering](p5-req-eng.md) | Delves into advanced techniques for requirements engineering, such as requirements traceability, validation, and management. Emphasizes importance of these techniques in ensuring complete, consistent, and verifiable software requirements. |
| 6 | [An interview with a stakeholder](p6-interview.md)  | Provides a real-world scenario of conducting an interview with a stakeholder to elicit requirements for the academic course registration system. Emphasizes importance of effective communication and stakeholder engagement in requirements engineering. | 

This table summarizes the different parts of the module and their respective descriptions. It provides an overview of the topics covered in the module, from the introduction to the advanced techniques, and emphasizes the practical aspects of requirements engineering, such as conducting stakeholder interviews and creating an SRD.

Overall, the module aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the requirements engineering process and the skills necessary to create an effective SRD for an academic course registration system. The module emphasizes the practical aspects of requirements engineering and provides students with real-world scenarios to enhance their learning.
