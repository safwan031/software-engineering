# Software Requirements Document (SRD): College Room Rental System

## Key steps in creating a College Room Rental System

Creating a college room rental system can be a complex project, but here are some key steps to consider:

#### Identify the requirements: 
Define the features and functionality of your college room rental system. For example, will it allow students to search for available rooms, reserve a room, pay for the reservation, or review past reservations?

#### 1. Design the system architecture: 
Create a high-level architecture for your system, including the database structure, user interface design, and technology stack. Choose the appropriate programming language, database management system, and front-end framework.

#### 2. Develop the backend: 
Develop the server-side of your system using the chosen technology stack. Implement the database schema, API endpoints, and server-side logic.

#### 3. Develop the frontend: 
Develop the client-side of your system using a front-end framework. Implement the user interface design, user authentication, and client-side logic.

#### 4. Test the system: 
Perform unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure the system functions correctly and is free from bugs and errors.

#### 5. Deploy the system: 
Deploy the system to a production environment and configure it for scalability, reliability, and security.

#### 6. Maintain the system: 
Continuously monitor the system and resolve any issues that arise. Provide support to users and make improvements and enhancements to the system as needed.
