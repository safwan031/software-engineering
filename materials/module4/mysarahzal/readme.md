# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Academic Advisor System
## Key steps in creating an Academic Advisor System

Developing an academic advisor system can be a complex process, but here are some key steps to consider:

### Define the Scope
Determine the scope of your academic advisor system. Identify the target audience, their needs, and the main features of the system.

### Conduct User Research
Conduct research to understand the needs and expectations of your target audience. This can involve surveys, interviews, and focus groups with students, faculty members, and academic advisors.

### Determine the Features
Based on the user research, identify the features and functionalities that will be included in the system. This may include features like academic planning, course scheduling, degree progress tracking, and communication tools.

### Design the User Interface
Design an interface that is easy to navigate and user-friendly. The user interface should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### Develop the System
Develop the academic advisor system based on the defined scope and features. The development process should include testing and quality assurance to ensure that the system is functioning correctly.

### Implement the System
Implement the system in the academic institution. This may involve training users and integrating the system with existing software and hardware.

### Test and Monitor
Test the system to ensure that it is working as intended. Monitor the system to identify and fix any issues or bugs that may arise.

### Continuous Improvement
Continue to improve the system based on user feedback and evolving needs. This may involve adding new features or functionalities and addressing any performance or security issues.

Overall, developing an academic advisor system requires a collaborative effort among stakeholders, including students, faculty, academic advisors, and IT professionals. By following these key steps, you can create an effective and user-friendly system that supports academic success for all users.

## Requirements Engineering
The requirements engineering process for an Academic Advisor System can be broken down into the following steps:

### Identify Stakeholders
The first step is to identify the stakeholders involved in the academic advisor system. This includes academic advisors, students, faculty members, and administrators.

### Gather Requirements
Next, gather requirements by conducting interviews, focus groups, surveys, and other methods to understand the needs of the stakeholders. The requirements gathered may include the following:

- Academic advisor interface: The academic advisor system should have an easy-to-use interface that allows advisors to manage their advisee list, track student progress, and access relevant   academic information.
-  Student interface: The system should have a student interface that allows students to schedule appointments with their academic advisors, view their academic progress, and receive relevant academic information.
- Course management: The system should allow academic advisors to manage course offerings, including course descriptions, prerequisites, and availability.
- Communication: The system should facilitate communication between academic advisors and their advisees, as well as between academic advisors and faculty members.
- Scheduling: The system should allow students to schedule appointments with their academic advisors, and academic advisors to manage their appointment schedule.

### Analyze Requirements
After gathering requirements, analyze them to identify any conflicts or inconsistencies, and prioritize them based on their importance and feasibility.

### Document Requirements
Document the requirements in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document that includes functional and non-functional requirements, use cases, and system constraints.

### Review and Validate Requirements
Review and validate the requirements with the stakeholders to ensure they accurately represent their needs and are feasible to implement.

### Manage Requirements
Manage the requirements throughout the development process, including tracking changes, resolving conflicts, and verifying that the system meets the requirements.

By following these steps, the requirements engineering process can ensure that the Academic Advisor System is developed to meet the needs of its stakeholders and provides a reliable and efficient solution for managing academic advising.
