# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Academic Advisor System

## Key steps in creating an Academic Advisor System
Developing an academic advisor system for a university involves several key steps:

### 1. Define the system's requirements
Identify the needs of the lecturers and students, and determine what features the system should have. This might include a calendar, a meeting website, a messaging system, and more.

### 2. Develop a system design
Based on the requirements, design the system's architecture, modules, components, and interfaces. Make sure to include the necessary security features and data privacy measures.

### 3. Choose the appropriate technology stack
Select the technologies and tools that are most appropriate for the system's development, such as programming languages, frameworks, and databases.

### 4. Develop the system
Implement the system design by writing code, configuring the hardware and software, and integrating components. Ensure that you test the system at each stage of development to ensure that it meets the requirements and functions as intended.

### 5. Implement the calendar feature
Develop a calendar feature that allows lecturers and students to schedule meetings, set reminders, and view upcoming events. This feature should also allow them to view other users' calendars and share their own.

### 6. Implement the meeting website feature
Develop a website that allows lecturers and students to join meetings, view past recordings, and download lecture materials. This feature should also allow them to schedule and manage meetings.

### 7. Implement other features
Based on the requirements, implement other features such as messaging, document sharing, and grading tools.

### 8. Test the system
Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure that the system functions as intended and meets the requirements. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

### 9. Deploy the system
Once the system has been tested and validated, deploy it to the target environment.

### 10. Maintain and support the system
After deployment, maintain and support the system by monitoring its performance, fixing bugs, and adding new features as needed.

### 11. Review and improve the system
Periodically review the system to ensure that it continues to meet the needs of the users and the organization. Use feedback to identify areas for improvement and make changes as necessary.


## Requirements For Developing An Academic Advisor System

The requirements engineering process for an academic advisor system typically involves the following steps:

### 1.Student and advisor profiles
The system should have profiles for both students and advisors. This will allow students to connect with their assigned advisors and allow advisors to access student information and academic records.

### 2. Appointment scheduling
The system should allow students to schedule appointments with their advisors, and advisors should be able to view their schedules and confirm appointments.

### 3. Course planning and scheduling
The system should allow students to plan their course schedules, view course availability, and register for classes. Advisors should be able to help students plan their courses and approve course selections.

### 4. Academic progress tracking
The system should allow students and advisors to track students' academic progress, including grades, credits earned, and completion of program requirements.

### 5. Resource and referral information
The system should provide access to academic resources, such as tutoring services, career counseling, and internships. Advisors should be able to provide referrals to students as needed.

### 6. Communication and messaging
The system should allow for easy communication between students and advisors, including messaging and email functionality.

### 7. Analytics and reporting
The system should provide analytics and reporting tools to help advisors track student progress, identify areas of concern, and generate reports as needed.

### 8. Security and privacy
The system should incorporate appropriate security and privacy measures to protect student data and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

### 9. Integration with other systems
The system should be able to integrate with other academic systems, such as student information systems and learning management systems.

In the context of an academic advisor system, the requirements engineering process should focus on ensuring that the system provides an intuitive and efficient user interface for students and faculty members to provides a comprehensive solution for academic advising and support. The system should also be designed to handle large volumes of data and be scalable to accommodate future growth in the university's student population.


## Stakeholders
Stakeholders in an academic advisor system can be broadly categorized into seven groups:

### 1. Students
Students are the primary users of the academic advising system. They rely on the system to access information about course schedules, academic requirements, and resources, and to connect with their advisors for guidance and support.

### 2. Academic advisors
Academic advisors use the system to manage their advising schedules, view student profiles, track student progress, and communicate with students.

### 3. Faculty and staff
Faculty and staff members may use the system to access information about student academic records and progress, as well as to provide support to students as needed.

### 4. Academic departments and programs
Academic departments and programs use the system to manage student progress and to ensure that students are meeting program requirements.

### 5. Administration
Administration may use the system to track student success and to evaluate the effectiveness of advising programs.

### 6. IT department
The IT department is responsible for managing and maintaining the academic advising system, ensuring that it is secure, reliable, and scalable.

### 7. Data analysts
Data analysts may use the system to collect and analyze data on student performance, program effectiveness, and other metrics.
