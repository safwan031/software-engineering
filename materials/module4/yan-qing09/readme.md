# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Health and Wellness Management System

 Key steps involved in creating a student health and wellness management system: 

## 1. System Requirements Gathering:
The first step in creating any system is to gather requirements from stakeholders. In this case, the stakeholders would be students, healthcare professionals, and school administrators. You can conduct interviews, surveys, and focus groups to gather requirements from these stakeholders. Some of the requirements for a student health and wellness management system may include the ability to track health records, schedule appointments, and receive reminders for upcoming appointments.

## 2. System Design:
Once you have gathered the requirements, the next step is to design the system. You will need to create a detailed system architecture that outlines the various components of the system and how they will interact with each other. This will include designing the user interface, the database schema, and the backend server.

## 3. System Development:
After the system design is complete, the next step is to develop the system. You will need to hire a team of developers to build the system according to the design. You will also need to test the system to ensure that it is working as intended. During the development process, you should also focus on making the system user-friendly and easy to use.

## 4. System Deployment:
Once the system has been developed and tested, the next step is to deploy it. This will involve installing the system on servers and configuring it to work with the school's existing IT infrastructure. You will also need to train school staff and students on how to use the system.

## 5. System Maintenance:
The final step is to maintain the system. This will involve fixing bugs, adding new features, and ensuring that the system is running smoothly. You will also need to keep the system up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against cyber attacks.

## Requirement Engineering

Overview of the steps involved in the requirement engineering process for a health and wellness management system:

1. Elicitation: This involves identifying and gathering information from stakeholders such as students, healthcare professionals, and school administrators. Different techniques can be used for elicitation, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observation. The goal of this step is to understand the needs and requirements of the stakeholders for the health and wellness management system.

2. Analysis: This step involves analyzing the information gathered during the elicitation process. The aim is to identify the features, functions, and requirements of the system. The analysis also helps to identify any constraints, risks, and challenges that may affect the system development.

3. Specification: In this step, the requirements are documented in detail. The specification includes a description of the system's features, functions, and constraints. The requirements specification can take the form of a software requirements specification document, which provides a detailed description of the system requirements.

4. Validation: Once the requirements specification is complete, it must be validated to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and consistent. This can be done through peer review, walkthroughs, and inspections. Validation ensures that the requirements accurately represent the stakeholders' needs and requirements for the health and wellness management system.

5. Verification: This step involves ensuring that the requirements can be implemented in the system design and development. Verification checks the feasibility of the requirements, including their compatibility with existing technology and infrastructure.

6. Management: Requirement management involves tracking and controlling changes to the requirements throughout the system development process. This includes documenting any changes made to the requirements, assessing the impact of those changes, and ensuring that the changes are communicated to all stakeholders.

## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements are the specific features and capabilities that a student health and wellness management system must possess to satisfy the needs of its users. Here are some functional requirements that a student health and wellness management system should have:

1. Registration and login: The system should provide a way for students, healthcare professionals, and school administrators to register and log in to the system with secure authentication.

2. Health record management: The system should allow students to access and manage their health records, including immunizations, allergies, medical conditions, and medications.

3. Appointment scheduling: The system should allow students to schedule appointments with healthcare professionals, view appointment schedules, and receive reminders for upcoming appointments.

4. Wellness tracking: The system should allow students to track their wellness goals, such as exercise, diet, and mental health, and provide resources and tips to support healthy habits.

5. Communication: The system should allow for secure communication between students, healthcare professionals, and school administrators, including messaging, notifications, and alerts.

6. Reporting and analytics: The system should provide reporting and analytics capabilities to track student health and wellness data, including trends, outcomes, and performance.

7. Student education: The system should provide educational resources for students to learn about health and wellness topics, including mental health, nutrition, and physical activity.

8. Emergency management: The system should provide a way to manage emergencies, such as injuries or illnesses, including notifications, alerts, and access to emergency services.

9. Privacy and security: The system should ensure the privacy and security of students' health and wellness data, including compliance with regulatory requirements, such as HIPAA.

10. System administration: The system should allow for system administration and management, including user management, system configuration, and backup and recovery.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance: The system should be responsive and efficient in performing its functions. For example, it should load quickly and process requests in a timely manner.

2. Security: The system should ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health and wellness information. It should also protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber attacks.

3. Scalability: The system should be able to handle an increasing number of users and data without compromising its performance and functionality.

4. Reliability: The system should be reliable and available at all times, with minimal downtime or system failures. It should also be able to recover quickly from any failures.
