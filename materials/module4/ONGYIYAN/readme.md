# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Student Health and Wellness Management System
## Key steps in developing the system

1.<b>Identifying the requirements</b>: The first step in developing a student health and wellness management system is to identify the requirements of the system. This involves understanding the needs of the university, the students, and the health and wellness professionals who will be using the system.

2.<b>Defining the scope</b>: Once the requirements have been identified, the scope of the project needs to be defined. This involves determining the features and functionalities that the system will have, as well as any constraints that may affect the development process.

3.<b>Designing the system architecture</b>: The next step is to design the system architecture. This involves determining the components of the system, their interactions, and how they will work together to achieve the desired functionalities.

4.<b>Developing the system</b>: After the system architecture has been designed, the next step is to start developing the system. This involves writing the code, creating the database, and integrating the different components of the system.

5.<b>Testing the system</b>: Once the system has been developed, it needs to be tested to ensure that it works as expected. This involves conducting various tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

6.<b>Deploying the system</b>: After the system has been tested and any issues have been resolved, the system can be deployed. This involves installing the system on the university's servers and making it available to the users.

7.<b>Providing training and support</b>: Once the system has been deployed, the final step is to provide training and support to the users. This involves providing documentation, training sessions, and ongoing technical support to ensure that the system is used effectively and efficiently.

## Steps involved in requirement engineering process

1. **Elicitation:** The first step in the requirement engineering process is to elicit the requirements from the stakeholders. In the case of a student health and wellness management system, stakeholders would include university staff, health and wellness professionals, and students. Various techniques can be used for elicitation, such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups.

3. **Analysis:** Once the requirements have been elicited, they need to be analyzed to identify their dependencies, conflicts, and feasibility. The analysis can be done using various tools and techniques, such as use case modeling, functional analysis, and non-functional analysis.

5. **Specification:** After the requirements have been analyzed, they need to be specified in a clear and concise manner. This involves creating a requirements document that describes the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, including any constraints and assumptions.

7. **Validation:** Once the requirements have been specified, they need to be validated to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and accurate. Validation can be done through various techniques, such as peer reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping.

9. **Management:** Finally, the requirements need to be managed throughout the development process to ensure that they are properly tracked, traced, and prioritized. This involves creating a requirements traceability matrix, which links the requirements to the design, implementation, and testing of the system.

## Stakeholders

1. **University Staff:** This includes administrators, professors, and support staff who are responsible for managing and supporting the system. They have a stake in the system's success because it affects their work and the overall functioning of the university.

2. **Health and Wellness Professionals:** This includes physicians, nurses, counselors, and other professionals who work in the health and wellness department of the university. They have a stake in the system's success because it affects their ability to provide quality care and support to the students.

3. **Students:** Students are the primary users of the system, and they have a stake in its success because it affects their health and well-being. They need a system that is easy to use, provides them with accurate and timely information, and enables them to access the services and support they need.

## User Requirements
