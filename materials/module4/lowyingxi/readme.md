# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Event Calendar for UTM

Define the purpose and scope: Decide on the purpose of the calendar and who the target audience is. Will it be for current students, faculty, staff, alumni, or the general public? Will it cover all events on campus or focus on specific types of events?

## 1)Choose a platform: 
Decide on the platform you will use to host and manage the calendar. This could be a pre-existing calendar tool or a custom solution.

## 2)Gather event information: 
Collect all necessary information about each event, including the name, date, time, location, description, and any other pertinent details.

## 3)Design the calendar:
Design the calendar with the end-user in mind. Consider the layout and user experience to make it easy to navigate and find events.

## 4)Populate the calendar: 
Add all the events to the calendar, making sure to include all relevant information.

## 5)Promote the calendar:
Promote the calendar to the target audience through various channels such as social media, email newsletters, flyers, and posters.

## 6)Maintain and update the calendar: 
Regularly update and maintain the calendar to keep it current and accurate. Assign someone to manage the calendar and review event submissions regularly to ensure it stays up to date.


## Stalkholders
- Event organizers: These stakeholders are responsible for planning and organizing events on campus. They will use the event management system to create event schedules, manage event registration, and track event attendance. They may also use the system to manage event budgets, request event space and resources, and communicate with event attendees.

- Students: Students are a crucial stakeholder for an event management system as they are the primary audience for campus events. They will use the system to view event schedules, register for events, and receive event reminders and updates. Students may also use the system to provide feedback on events and suggest new event ideas.

- Administrative staff: Administrative staff, such as event coordinators or university officials, are responsible for overseeing and managing events on campus. They will use the event management system to track event attendance, manage event budgets, and ensure that events comply with university policies and regulations. Administrative staff may also use the system to analyze event data and metrics to improve future events.

- Faculty members: Faculty members may be involved in organizing academic events, such as conferences or guest lectures, and may use the event management system to manage event logistics and communicate with event attendees.

- Facilities management: Facilities management staff are responsible for managing and maintaining the physical facilities on campus. They may use the event management system to ensure that event spaces are available and properly equipped, and to coordinate with event organizers on any needed setup or cleanup.
## Requirements Engineering
Requirements engineering is the process of eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the requirements for a software system. In the context of an university event management system, the requirements engineering process is crucial for ensuring that the system meets the needs of its stakeholders, including students, faculty members, and university administrators.

-IT staff: IT staff are responsible for managing the technical infrastructure of the event management system, such as servers, databases, and network security. They may also provide technical support to users of the system and ensure that the system is compatible with other university systems and tools.
The requirements engineering process for an university event management system typically involves the following steps:
# Requirements Engineering

## Gather information: 
The first step is to gather information about the users and their needs. For UTM, the main users would be students, faculty, and staff. Some important questions to consider during this phase are:
- What kind of events do users want to see on the calendar?
- What information do they need to know about the events (date, time, location, description, etc.)?
- How frequently do events occur and how far in advance do users need to know about them?
- How will users access the calendar (website, mobile app, etc.)?

## Define functional requirements: 
Based on the information gathered, the next step is to define the functional requirements of the event calendar. These are the specific features and functions the calendar must perform to meet the needs of users. Some potential functional requirements for UTM's event calendar might include:
- Ability to search and filter events by category, date, and location
- Ability to add events to a personal calendar or set reminders
- Integration with other UTM systems (such as the course registration system or campus map)
- Ability for event organizers to submit events for approval and add details to their listings
- Ability for users to provide feedback on events or suggest new events

## Define non-functional requirements:
In addition to functional requirements, non-functional requirements define the qualities and characteristics the event calendar must possess. Some non-functional requirements for UTM's event calendar might include:
- Usability: The calendar should be easy to navigate and use, with clear labels and intuitive design.
- Performance: The calendar should load quickly and be able to handle a large volume of events and users without crashing or slowing down.
- Security: The calendar should be secure and protect user data from unauthorized access or misuse.
- Accessibility: The calendar should be accessible to users with disabilities, complying with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0.
- Prioritize requirements: Once all the requirements are defined, it's important to prioritize them based on their importance and feasibility. This can be done by ranking each requirement on a scale of 1-5 for importance and difficulty. This helps ensure that the most critical and achievable requirements are implemented first.

## Validate requirements:
Finally, the requirements should be validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately capture the needs of users and can be met within the project timeline and budget. Feedback from stakeholders can be incorporated into the requirements documentation before development begins.
