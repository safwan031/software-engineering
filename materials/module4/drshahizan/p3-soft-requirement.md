# Part 3: Requirements Specification

A requirements specification is a document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system or application. It is a critical document that acts as a blueprint for the development process, as it lays out the scope of the project, its objectives, and the features and functionality required to meet those objectives. 

The requirements specification is typically created during the initial stages of software development, and it serves as a guide for the entire development team, including project managers, developers, testers, and stakeholders. The document includes information such as project scope, goals, and objectives, as well as detailed descriptions of the features and functionality required for the system.

The requirements specification document typically includes the following information:

1. **Introduction**: This section provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, scope, and stakeholders.

2. **Functional Requirements**: This section outlines the specific features and functionality that the system must have to meet its objectives. It includes use cases, user stories, and other detailed descriptions of the software's behavior.

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: This section covers requirements that are not directly related to the software's functionality, such as performance, security, and reliability.

4. **Assumptions and Constraints**: This section includes any assumptions made during the requirements gathering process and any constraints that may affect the development process.

5. **Acceptance Criteria**: This section outlines the criteria that the system must meet to be considered acceptable by stakeholders.

6. **Glossary**: This section defines any technical terms or acronyms used in the document.

Overall, the requirements specification document plays a crucial role in the software development process. It ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project's objectives and what is expected from the final product. It also helps to minimize misunderstandings and ensures that the development team can deliver a product that meets the needs of the business and its users.

## IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD)

The IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) is a standard document format used to specify the requirements for a software system. In the context of an academic course registration system, the SRD would describe the requirements for the software system that manages the registration process for students, faculty, and staff.

The following is an outline of the SRD for an academic course registration system:

1. **Introduction**: This section would introduce the software system and provide an overview of its purpose and scope. It would also describe the intended users of the system, including students, faculty, and staff.

2. **Functional Requirements**: This section would describe the specific functions that the software system must perform, such as:

    - Student registration: The system should allow students to register for courses, view their course schedules, and drop or add courses as needed.
    - Faculty management: The system should allow faculty to manage their course offerings, view their class rosters, and submit grades.
    - Administrative tasks: The system should allow administrators to manage the course catalog, view enrollment statistics, and generate reports.
    - User authentication: The system should require users to authenticate themselves before accessing any sensitive data.

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: This section would describe the performance, security, and other non-functional requirements of the system, such as:

    - Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without experiencing significant slowdowns or crashes.
    - Security: The system should be designed with robust security features to protect sensitive user data from unauthorized access.
    - Usability: The system should be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and intuitive interfaces.

4. **System Constraints**: This section would describe any technical or organizational constraints that must be taken into account during the design and development of the system, such as:

    - Hardware and software requirements: The system should be compatible with a range of hardware and software configurations.
    - Data storage requirements: The system should be able to store and manage large amounts of data, including student and faculty records, course schedules, and enrollment data.
    - Organizational policies: The system should comply with any relevant organizational policies or regulations, such as data privacy laws or student registration rules.

5. **Glossary**: This section would provide definitions for any technical terms or acronyms used throughout the document.

Overall, the IEEE Software Requirements Document provides a comprehensive framework for specifying the requirements of a software system. In the context of an academic course registration system, the SRD would help ensure that the software system meets the needs of its users and operates effectively within the constraints of the organization.

## Agile methods

Agile methods are an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. In the context of an academic course registration system, Agile methods can be used to develop and refine the software system's requirements, using the IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) as a foundation.

The following are some key aspects of Agile methods that can be applied to the requirements specification process for an academic course registration system:

1. **Collaboration**: Agile methods emphasize collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and end-users. In the context of an academic course registration system, this could involve regular meetings between the development team, faculty members, and student representatives to discuss requirements, provide feedback, and address any issues that arise.

2. **Incremental Development**: Agile methods encourage incremental development, with software features being developed and tested in small, manageable increments. This allows for continuous feedback and iteration, which can help refine the requirements for the system as development progresses.

3. **User Stories**: Agile methods often use user stories to describe the functional requirements of a software system. These are brief, plain-language descriptions of specific system features, written from the perspective of the end-user. For an academic course registration system, user stories could describe tasks such as registering for courses, viewing grades, or updating personal information.

4. **Prototyping**: Agile methods often use prototyping to quickly create working models of software features, which can be tested and refined in real-time. This can help identify any issues or problems with the requirements early on, before significant time and resources have been invested in development.

5. **Continuous Improvement**: Agile methods encourage continuous improvement through regular feedback, testing, and iteration. In the context of an academic course registration system, this could involve regular user testing sessions, faculty and staff feedback, and ongoing refinement of the SRD.

Overall, Agile methods can be a useful approach for developing and refining the requirements of an academic course registration system. By emphasizing collaboration, incremental development, user stories, prototyping, and continuous improvement, Agile methods can help ensure that the software system meets the needs of its users and operates effectively within the constraints of the organization. The IEEE Software Requirements Document can serve as a useful foundation for this process, providing a structured framework for specifying the requirements of the system.

## Requirements specification: User requirements and system requirements

Requirements specification is a critical step in software development, where the requirements for a system are documented and defined in a clear and concise manner. In the context of an academic course registration system, there are two types of requirements that are typically identified: user requirements and system requirements.

### User requirements
User requirements are typically identified through interviews with stakeholders such as students, faculty members, and staff who will use the system. These requirements describe what the users of the system need the system to do, and what functionality they require. Examples of user requirements for an academic course registration system may include:

- The ability for students to search for and register for courses online
- The ability for faculty members to manage course listings, including adding and removing courses
- The ability for staff to generate reports on enrollment data and other statistics
- The need for the system to be accessible to users with disabilities, such as those who are visually impaired.

### System requirements
System requirements, on the other hand, describe the technical aspects of the system, including how the system will be implemented, what hardware and software will be required, and how the system will be tested. Examples of system requirements for an academic course registration system may include:

- The system should be developed using a web-based architecture, and should be accessible via a standard web browser.
- The system should be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and should comply with the latest web standards.
- The system should be able to handle large volumes of data, including enrollment data for thousands of students each semester.
- The system should be tested rigorously, with automated tests developed to ensure that all features are working as expected.

In order to ensure that the requirements specification accurately reflects the needs of the stakeholders and the technical constraints of the system, it is important to use a variety of techniques, such as interviews, surveys, and prototyping. In addition, it is important to involve stakeholders in the review and approval of the requirements specification, to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the system is developed in a way that meets the needs of all users.

In summary, requirements specification is a critical step in the development of an academic course registration system. By identifying and documenting user requirements and system requirements, development teams can ensure that the system is developed in a way that meets the needs of its users and technical constraints.

## Ways of Writing a System Requirements Specification

When writing a system requirements specification for an academic course registration system, there are several ways to document the requirements. Here are some approaches:

1. **Natural language**: The most common way of writing requirements is to use natural language, such as English. This approach is easy to understand for stakeholders who may not have technical expertise, but it can also be prone to ambiguity and inconsistency.

    > Example: "The system shall allow students to search for courses by course title, course code, and instructor name."

2. **Structured natural language**: This approach uses a predefined structure to ensure consistency and reduce ambiguity in natural language requirements. It typically involves using keywords to specify the type of requirement, such as "shall," "should," or "may."

    > Example: "The system shall allow students to search for courses by course title, course code, and instructor name, and shall return results within 5 seconds."

3. **Design description language**: Design description languages (DDLs) are formal languages used to specify design requirements. They typically have a syntax and vocabulary that are more precise than natural language, which can make them less prone to ambiguity.

    > Example: "The system shall include a search function that allows students to search for courses using keywords, such as course title, course code, and instructor name. The search function shall return a list of results within 5 seconds."

4. **Graphical notations**: Graphical notations, such as UML diagrams, can be used to represent requirements visually. They are useful for conveying complex requirements in a clear and concise manner.

    > Example: A use case diagram could be used to represent the various user interactions with the course registration system, including searching for courses, registering for courses, and managing course listings.

5. **Mathematical specifications**: Mathematical specifications use formal mathematical notation to specify requirements precisely. This approach is less common in practice, but it can be useful for systems with very strict requirements, such as safety-critical systems.

    > Example: "For all courses C and students S, if S is registered for C, then S shall not be registered for any other course that conflicts with C in terms of time and location."

In summary, there are several ways to write a system requirements specification for an academic course registration system, including natural language, structured natural language, design description languages, graphical notations, and mathematical specifications. The approach used will depend on the specific requirements of the system and the preferences of the development team.

## Requirements and Design
In principle, requirements should state WHAT the system should do, and the design should describe HOW it does this. This means that requirements define the desired outcomes or goals of the system, while design details the specific implementation that will achieve those outcomes.

In the case of an academic course registration system, the requirements might include:

- The system should allow students to search for courses by course title, course code, and instructor name.
- The system should allow students to register for courses and drop courses before the registration deadline.
- The system should allow instructors to manage their course listings, including adding or removing courses and updating course details.
- The system should ensure that students cannot register for courses that conflict with each other in terms of time and location.

Based on these requirements, the design of the system might include:

- A search function that allows students to search for courses using keywords, such as course title, course code, and instructor name.
- A user interface that allows students to easily register for and drop courses.
- A database that stores course listings and user information, and that is accessible to both students and instructors.
- An algorithm that checks for scheduling conflicts and prevents students from registering for conflicting courses.

The design might also include details about the system architecture, data structures, algorithms, and other technical aspects of the system.

By separating requirements and design in this way, it is possible to ensure that the system meets the needs of its users while also being well-engineered and maintainable. Requirements define the goals and expectations of the system, while design defines the specific implementation that will achieve those goals. By clearly defining these two aspects of the system, it is possible to create a robust, user-friendly, and efficient academic course registration system that meets the needs of students and instructors alike.

## Natural Language Specification
A natural language specification is a type of requirement specification that uses natural language, such as English, to describe the requirements of a system. This approach is widely used because it is easy to understand and can be written by stakeholders who may not have technical expertise. In the context of an academic course registration system, the natural language specification can be used to document the requirements in the IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD).

Here are some examples of natural language requirements for an academic course registration system:

1. The system shall allow students to search for courses by course title, course code, and instructor name.

2. The system shall allow students to register for courses and drop courses before the registration deadline.

3. The system shall allow instructors to manage their course listings, including adding or removing courses and updating course details.

4. The system shall ensure that students cannot register for courses that conflict with each other in terms of time and location.

5. The system shall provide email notifications to students when they register for a course or when there is a change to their course schedule.

These requirements are written in natural language and are easy to understand for stakeholders. They specify the functionality that the academic course registration system should have and the constraints that should be imposed on the system.

It is important to note that natural language specifications can be prone to ambiguity and inconsistencies, which can lead to misunderstandings and errors. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the requirements are clear, concise, and unambiguous. This can be achieved by using a structured natural language approach or by supplementing the natural language specification with other specification techniques, such as graphical notations or mathematical specifications.

## Guidelines for Writing Requirements
Writing requirements is a critical step in software development, and the quality of the requirements directly affects the success of the software project. Here are some guidelines for writing requirements for an academic course registration system, following the IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) format:

1. **Use clear and concise language**: Requirements should be written in clear and concise language that is easy to understand. Avoid using technical jargon or ambiguous terms that may be misinterpreted.

    > "The system shall allow students to search for courses using the course title, course code, and instructor name."

2. **Use a consistent format**: Use a consistent format for presenting requirements, such as using bullet points or numbered lists. This will make it easier to read and understand the requirements.

    > "The system shall allow students to register for courses, drop courses, and view their current schedule."

3. **Be specific**: Requirements should be specific and detailed enough to provide a clear understanding of what is expected from the system. Avoid vague or general statements.

    > Specific requirements: "The system shall prevent students from registering for courses that have scheduling conflicts."

4. **Avoid including implementation details**: Requirements should focus on what the system should do, not how it should do it. Avoid including implementation details in the requirements.

    > "The system shall allow instructors to add, edit, and delete course information."

5. **Ensure requirements are testable**: Each requirement should be testable, meaning that it should be possible to determine whether the requirement has been met or not.

    > Testable requirements: "The system shall notify students via email when they register for a course."

6. **Use a traceability matrix**: Use a traceability matrix to ensure that each requirement can be traced back to the specific need or stakeholder requirement it addresses.

    > "Requirement #1 - System shall allow students to search for courses - traced to Stakeholder Need #3 - Allow students to find relevant courses quickly and easily."

7. **Involve stakeholders**: Involve stakeholders, such as students, faculty, and staff, in the requirements gathering process to ensure that all their needs and expectations are captured.

    > "Stakeholder interviews revealed that students would like to be able to register for courses using a mobile device, so the requirement 'The system shall be accessible via mobile devices' was added."

By following these guidelines, the IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) for an academic course registration system can be well-structured and well-documented, ensuring that all stakeholders' needs and expectations are met.

## Problems With Natural Language

While natural language is the most commonly used way of writing requirements, it has some potential problems that can lead to misunderstandings or ambiguities. Some of the problems associated with natural language include:

1. **Ambiguity**: Natural language is often open to interpretation, and the same sentence can mean different things to different people. For example, the requirement "The system shall be fast" can be interpreted differently by different stakeholders.

    > The requirement "The system shall provide an easy-to-use interface" may be interpreted differently by different stakeholders. Some may consider a simple design to be easy to use, while others may prefer a more complex design that provides more features.


2. **Lack of precision**: Natural language is often imprecise and lacks the level of detail required for complex systems. For example, the requirement "The system shall be user-friendly" may not provide enough detail about what is expected from the system.

    > The requirement "The system shall allow students to register for courses online" may not provide enough detail about how the registration process will work, how course availability will be displayed, or how conflicts will be resolved.

3. **Inconsistency**: Different stakeholders may use different terminology, leading to inconsistencies in the requirements. For example, one stakeholder may use the term "course code" while another may use "course identifier".

    > The term "course code" may be used interchangeably with "course number", leading to confusion among stakeholders.

4. **Difficulty in managing changes**: Natural language requirements can be difficult to manage and maintain, especially when changes are made to the requirements. It can be challenging to ensure that all affected requirements are updated.

    > If a stakeholder requests a change to the requirement "The system shall notify students when a course is cancelled", it may be challenging to ensure that all affected requirements are updated.


5. **Difficulty in traceability**: Natural language requirements can be difficult to trace back to their source, which can make it difficult to ensure that all stakeholder needs are met.

    > If a requirement is not traced back to its source, it may be unclear which stakeholder need it is addressing.

To overcome these problems, other methods of writing requirements, such as structured natural language, design description language, graphical notations, or mathematical specifications, can be used. These methods can provide greater precision, consistency, and traceability, but may require more specialized skills or tools to implement.

## Example of Requirements for an Academic Course Registration System
Example requirements for an academic course registration system using the format "The system shall measure..." and "The system shall run...":

Sure! I can provide more details on the example requirements for an academic course registration system.

1. **The system shall measure the number of students enrolled in each course.**
This requirement is important for keeping track of course popularity and ensuring that classes have enough students to run. The system should be able to display this information to administrators so that they can make informed decisions about course offerings.

2. **The system shall measure the number of seats available in each course.**
Similar to the previous requirement, this one is important for ensuring that courses have enough capacity to accommodate all interested students. The system should display this information to students so that they can see which courses have available spots.

3. **The system shall measure the average time taken for a student to complete the registration process.**
This requirement is important for optimizing the registration process and identifying potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement. The system should be able to track the time that students spend on each step of the registration process and provide this information to administrators.

4. **The system shall measure the average time taken for a student to find and add a course to their schedule.**
Similar to the previous requirement, this one is important for optimizing the user experience and identifying areas for improvement. The system should be able to track the time that students spend searching for courses, adding them to their schedule, and completing the registration process.

5. **The system shall run on any modern web browser.**
This requirement ensures that the system is accessible to as many users as possible. The system should be designed to be compatible with all major web browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) and should not require any specific software or plugins.

6. **The system shall run on both desktop and mobile devices.**
Similar to the previous requirement, this one is important for ensuring accessibility and convenience for users. The system should be designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, so that students can easily register for courses from their phones or tablets.

7. **The system shall run smoothly with up to 500 concurrent users.**
This requirement is important for ensuring that the system can handle peak traffic without crashing or slowing down. The system should be designed to scale up as needed to accommodate a large number of users, such as during the registration period.

8. **The system shall run regular database backups to ensure data integrity.**
This requirement is important for data security and protection against loss or corruption. The system should be designed to automatically back up all data on a regular basis, such as daily or weekly.

9. **The system shall run regular security checks to detect and prevent potential security breaches**.
This requirement is important for protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access. The system should be designed to regularly scan for vulnerabilities and take action to mitigate any identified risks.

10. **The system shall run a course conflict check to prevent students from registering for overlapping courses**. This requirement is important for ensuring that students do not accidentally register for conflicting courses, which could cause scheduling issues or other problems. The system should be designed to check for conflicts and prevent students from registering for courses that overlap in time or content.

## Structured specifications

Structured specifications are a type of formal method for writing software requirements that use a specific syntax and structure to describe the behavior and functionality of the system. This approach is often used in safety-critical systems or applications that require a high level of reliability or accuracy.

In the context of an academic course registration system, structured specifications could be used to describe the behavior of the system in a more precise and rigorous way. One approach to structured specifications is to use a tabular format, where each row represents a specific requirement and each column represents a different aspect of that requirement, such as inputs, outputs, preconditions, and postconditions. Here is an example of a structured specification for a requirement in the academic course registration system:

| Requirement ID | R1 |
| --- | --- |
| Description | The system shall allow students to search for courses by course code or keyword. |
| Inputs | Course code or keyword |
| Outputs | List of courses that match the search criteria |
| Preconditions | The student is logged in to the system |
| Postconditions | The search results are displayed on the screen |

In this example, the requirement is described in a clear and concise way, and each aspect of the requirement is spelled out in detail. By using a structured specification approach, it is easier to ensure that all requirements are well-defined, complete, and unambiguous, which can help to reduce errors and improve the overall quality of the system.

Another approach to structured specifications is to use a formal language, such as Z notation or B method, which provide a more rigorous and mathematically precise way to describe software behavior. While these approaches can be more time-consuming and require specialized skills, they are useful in situations where the system requirements are particularly complex or critical.

### A Structured Specification of a Requirement for an academic course registration system

**Example 1: Course Registration**

| Title | Course Registration |
| --- | --- |
| Function | Allow students to register for courses |
| Description | The system should enable students to sign up for courses they wish to take |
| Inputs | Student ID, course ID |
| Source | Student |
| Outputs | Course registration confirmation |
| Destination | Student |

This table includes the following information:

- **Title:** A brief title that summarizes the requirement.
- **Function:** A description of the system behavior that is required to fulfill the requirement.
- **Description:** A more detailed explanation of what the requirement entails.
- **Inputs:** The data or information required as input for the requirement to be executed successfully.
- **Source:** The entity or system that provides the inputs.
- **Outputs:** The data or information that will be produced by the requirement.
- **Destination:** The entity or system that receives the outputs.

In this example, the requirement is for the system to allow students to register for courses. The inputs are the student's ID and the course ID, which will be provided by the student. The system will then generate a course registration confirmation, which will be sent back to the student. This structured specification provides a clear and unambiguous description of the requirement, making it easier to understand and implement.

**Example 2: Course Catalog**
Sure, here are a few more examples of structured specifications for requirements in an academic course registration system, using the table format you specified:

| Title | Course Catalog |
| --- | --- |
| Function | Display a list of available courses |
| Description | The system should allow students to view all available courses and their details |
| Inputs | None |
| Source | System |
| Outputs | List of courses with their descriptions |
| Destination | Student |

In this example, the requirement is for the system to display a list of available courses to the student. The input is none, as the system will generate the list. The output is a list of all available courses with their descriptions, which will be displayed to the student.

**Example 3: Waitlist**

| Title | Waitlist |
| --- | --- |
| Function | Allow students to add themselves to a waitlist |
| Description | The system should enable students to add themselves to a waitlist for a full course |
| Inputs | Student ID, course ID |
| Source | Student |
| Outputs | Waitlist confirmation |
| Destination | Student |

In this example, the requirement is for the system to allow students to add themselves to a waitlist for a full course. The inputs are the student's ID and the course ID, which will be provided by the student. The system will then generate a waitlist confirmation, which will be sent back to the student.

**Example 4: Course Schedule**

| Title | Course Schedule |
| --- | --- |
| Function | Generate a course schedule |
| Description | The system should create a course schedule for each student based on their selected courses |
| Inputs | Student ID, list of selected course IDs |
| Source | Student |
| Outputs | Personalized course schedule |
| Destination | Student |

In this example, the requirement is for the system to generate a course schedule for each student based on their selected courses. The inputs are the student's ID and a list of course IDs that they have selected. The system will then generate a personalized course schedule for the student, which will be sent back to them.
