# Software Requirements Document (SRD): Academic Advisor System
The academic advisor system is a software system designed to assist students in their academic pursuits, and as such, it requires a well-defined set of requirements to function effectively. Below is a proposed process for the requirement engineering of an academic advisor system:

### Define the Scope
The primary target audience for the academic advisor system is students enrolled in the institution. Secondary audiences may include academic advisors, faculty members, and administrators who may need to access the system to support student success.

### Conduct User Research
Conduct research to understand the needs and expectations of your target audience. This can involve surveys, interviews, and focus groups with students, faculty members, and academic advisors.

### Determine the Features
Based on the user research, identify the features and functionalities that will be included in the system. This may include features like academic planning, course scheduling, degree progress tracking, and communication tools.

### Design the User Interface
Design an interface that is easy to navigate and user-friendly. The user interface should be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### Develop the System
Develop the academic advisor system based on the defined scope and features. The development process should include testing and quality assurance to ensure that the system is functioning correctly.

### Implement the System
Implement the system in the academic institution. This may involve training users and integrating the system with existing software and hardware.

### Test and Monitor
Test the system to ensure that it is working as intended. Monitor the system to identify and fix any issues or bugs that may arise.

### Continuous Improvement
Continue to improve the system based on user feedback and evolving needs. This may involve adding new features or functionalities and addressing any performance or security issues.

Overall, developing an academic advisor system requires a collaborative effort among stakeholders, including students, faculty, academic advisors, and IT professionals. By following these key steps, you can create an effective and user-friendly system that supports academic success for all users.
