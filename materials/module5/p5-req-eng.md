# Part 5: Advance Requirements Engineering 

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system. The IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) is a standard document that specifies the requirements for a software system in a clear and concise manner.

The following are the generic activities that are common to all requirements engineering processes:

| Generic Activities  | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Requirements elicitation | Gathering requirements from stakeholders by identifying their needs and documenting their requirements. |
| Requirements analysis | Analyzing and refining the requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. |
| Requirements validation | Verifying that the requirements meet the needs of stakeholders by checking if they are feasible, testable, and traceable. |
| Requirements management | Organizing and controlling the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle by identifying changes, tracking their status, and ensuring proper documentation and communication. | 


The process of creating an SRD for an academic course registration system. The following are the steps involved in creating an SRD:

1. Identify the stakeholders: In this step, we need to identify the stakeholders of the academic course registration system. These stakeholders may include students, faculty, administrators, and staff.

2. Elicit the requirements: In this step, we need to gather the requirements from the stakeholders. We can use techniques such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups to elicit the requirements.

3. Analyze the requirements: In this step, we need to analyze and refine the requirements that have been elicited. We should ensure that the requirements are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.

4. Validate the requirements: In this step, we need to verify that the requirements meet the needs of the stakeholders. We should ensure that the requirements are feasible, testable, and traceable.

5. Document the requirements: In this step, we need to document the requirements in the form of an SRD. The SRD should be clear and concise, and it should include all the requirements that have been elicited, analyzed, and validated.

6. Manage the requirements: In this step, we need to organize and control the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. We should identify changes to the requirements, track their status, and ensure that they are properly documented and communicated to stakeholders.

In conclusion, the process of requirements engineering is crucial in the development of software systems. By following the generic activities of requirements elicitation, analysis, validation, and management, and by creating an SRD for an academic course registration system, we can ensure that the requirements are clear, concise, and meet the needs of the stakeholders.

## Requirements elicitation and analysis

Requirements elicitation and analysis are two important stages of the requirements engineering process that are critical to the success of a software development project. 

Sure, here is a table that summarizes the generic activities of requirements engineering:

| Generic Activities  | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Requirements elicitation | Gathering requirements from stakeholders by identifying their needs and documenting their requirements. |
| Requirements analysis | Analyzing and refining the requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. |
| Requirements validation | Verifying that the requirements meet the needs of stakeholders by checking if they are feasible, testable, and traceable. |
| Requirements management | Organizing and controlling the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle by identifying changes, tracking their status, and ensuring proper documentation and communication. | 

The following are some of the techniques used for requirements elicitation and analysis:

1. **Interviews**: One-on-one interviews with stakeholders can be used to gather information about their needs and requirements. This technique allows for a more in-depth understanding of the stakeholder's perspective.

2. **Surveys**: Surveys can be used to gather information from a large number of stakeholders. This technique is useful when the stakeholders are geographically dispersed.

3. **Focus groups**: Focus groups involve bringing together a group of stakeholders to discuss their needs and requirements. This technique allows for the exchange of ideas and can lead to new insights.

4. **Observations**: Observations involve observing stakeholders as they interact with the current system or perform their work. This technique can provide valuable insights into the stakeholders' needs and requirements.

5. **Prototyping**: Prototyping involves creating a working model of the software system. This technique can be used to gather feedback from stakeholders and refine the requirements.

6. **Use case analysis**: Use cases are scenarios that describe how the software system will be used. Use case analysis involves identifying the actors, defining the use cases, and specifying the interactions between the actors and the system.

In conclusion, requirements elicitation and analysis are crucial stages of the requirements engineering process. By using various techniques such as interviews, surveys, focus groups, observations, and prototyping, we can gather and analyze requirements to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous. By doing so, we can increase the chances of delivering a software system that meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

## The stages of requirements elicitation and analysis

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Requirements discovery | Conduct interviews, surveys, focus groups, and observations to gather requirements from stakeholders such as students, faculty, and staff. Identify the stakeholders' needs and expectations for the course registration system. |
| Requirements classification and organization | Classify the requirements into categories such as functional, non-functional, and performance requirements. Organize the requirements into a requirements document that is easy to read and understand. |
| Requirements prioritization and negotiation | Prioritize the requirements based on their importance to stakeholders and the feasibility of implementing them. Negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between conflicting requirements. |
| Requirements specification | Specify the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner. Use techniques such as use case analysis and prototyping to refine the requirements. |

### 1. The requirements discovery stage

| Requirements Discovery | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Interviews | Conduct one-on-one interviews with students, faculty, and staff to gather information about their needs and expectations for the course registration system. Ask open-ended questions to encourage stakeholders to provide detailed feedback. |
| Surveys | Send out a survey to all students, faculty, and staff to gather feedback on the current course registration system and suggestions for improvement. |
| Focus groups | Bring together groups of students, faculty, and staff to discuss their needs and expectations for the course registration system. Encourage stakeholders to share their experiences and provide feedback on the current system. |
| Observations | Observe students, faculty, and staff as they use the current course registration system. Identify pain points and areas where the system could be improved. |

### 2. Tthe requirements classification and organization stage

| Requirements Classification and Organization | Description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Functional requirements | Specify the system functions that are required such as registering for courses, dropping courses, and viewing course schedules. |
| Non-functional requirements | Specify the system attributes such as usability, performance, and reliability. |
| Performance requirements | Specify the system response times, throughput, and resource utilization. |
| Requirements document | Organize the requirements into a document that is easy to read and understand. Include sections such as introduction, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and performance requirements. |

### 3. The requirements prioritization and negotiation stage

| Requirements Prioritization and Negotiation | Description |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Prioritization | Prioritize the requirements based on their importance to stakeholders and the feasibility of implementing them. Use techniques such as MoSCoW prioritization (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize the requirements. |
| Negotiation | Negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between conflicting requirements. Use techniques such as compromise and problem-solving to reach agreements. |

### 4. The requirements specification stage

| Requirements Specification | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Use case analysis | Identify the actors (students, faculty, staff) and use cases (register for a course, drop a course, view course schedule) for the course registration system. Specify the interactions between the actors and the system. |
| Prototyping | Develop a prototype of the course registration system to gather feedback from stakeholders and refine the requirements. |
| Requirements document | Specify the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner in the requirements document. Use techniques such as functional decomposition to break down complex requirements into smaller, more manageable requirements. |

During the requirements elicitation and analysis process, it's important to involve all relevant stakeholders and to gather as much information as possible about their needs and expectations for the system. This will help ensure that the final system meets the requirements of all stakeholders and is therefore more likely to be successful. It's also important to document the requirements in a clear and unambiguous manner, using techniques such as use case analysis and prototyping to refine the requirements over time. This will help ensure that the requirements are well-understood by all stakeholders and that they can be used as a basis for designing and implementing the system. Finally, it's important to prioritize the requirements based on their importance to stakeholders and the feasibility of implementing them, and to negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between conflicting requirements.

## Problems of Requirements Elicitation

Requirements elicitation is a complex process that involves gathering information from multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives and goals. As a result, there are several challenges that can arise during the requirements elicitation process, including:

A table summarizing the problems of requirements elicitation in the context of an academic course registration system:

| Problem | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Ambiguity | Requirements may be unclear, incomplete, or open to interpretation, making it difficult to determine what is actually needed. |
| Incomplete or changing requirements | Stakeholders may not fully understand their needs or may change their requirements over time, making it difficult to finalize requirements. |
| Communication barriers | Stakeholders may have different backgrounds, expertise, or priorities, which can make it difficult to communicate effectively and understand each other's needs. |
| Stakeholder conflicts | Stakeholders may have conflicting requirements or priorities, which can be difficult to resolve and may require negotiation and compromise. |
| Lack of user involvement | Users may not be fully engaged in the requirements elicitation process, which can result in requirements that don't fully address their needs or are difficult to use. |
| Technical constraints | There may be technical constraints that limit the feasibility or practicality of certain requirements, making it difficult to implement them. |

To address these challenges, it's important to have a structured and iterative approach to requirements elicitation that involves ongoing communication and collaboration with stakeholders. Techniques such as prototyping, use case analysis, and stakeholder interviews can help to clarify requirements and ensure that they are well-understood by all stakeholders. It's also important to prioritize requirements and negotiate with stakeholders to resolve conflicts and identify trade-offs between competing requirements.

## Requirements discovery

Requirements discovery is the process of identifying and gathering information about the requirements for the academic course registration system. This stage involves eliciting requirements from various sources to ensure that all stakeholders' needs are captured accurately.

During the requirements discovery phase, it is important to conduct thorough research and analysis to ensure that all requirements are captured accurately. This can involve conducting interviews, surveys, focus groups, and other forms of communication to gather information from stakeholders. Once the information has been collected, it must be analyzed, classified, and organized to ensure that the requirements are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.

| Source of Information | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation | Existing documentation related to the system, such as user manuals, technical specifications, and other relevant documents can provide valuable insights into the system's functionality, limitations, and constraints. This information can be used to identify existing features and requirements that need to be improved or updated. |
| System Stakeholders | Individuals or groups who have a stake in the academic course registration system, including users, administrators, and developers, can provide valuable feedback on their requirements and expectations. Stakeholders can be interviewed or surveyed to identify their needs and preferences, and their feedback can be used to shape the system's requirements. |
| Specification from Similar Systems | Requirements or specifications from other course registration systems that are similar to the one being developed can provide valuable information on what has worked in the past and what changes may need to be made to suit the specific needs of this system. By analyzing similar systems, developers can identify common features and requirements that can be used to inform the development of the new system. |

The requirements discovery phase is critical to the success of the academic course registration system development project, and it is essential to involve all stakeholders in the process to ensure that their needs are met.

A table summarizing the requirements discovery phase in the context of an academic course registration system:

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Requirements Discovery | The process of identifying and gathering information about the requirements for the academic course registration system. This stage involves eliciting requirements from various sources to ensure that all stakeholders' needs are captured accurately. |
| Sources of Information | - Documentation: Existing documentation related to the system, such as user manuals, technical specifications, and other relevant documents.<br><br>- System stakeholders: Individuals or groups who have a stake in the academic course registration system, including users, administrators, and developers.<br><br>- Specification from similar systems: Requirements or specifications from other course registration systems that are similar to the one being developed. |
| Techniques | - Interviews: One-on-one discussions with stakeholders to gather information about their needs and requirements.<br><br>- Surveys: Collecting feedback from stakeholders using surveys and questionnaires.<br><br>- Focus groups: Group discussions with stakeholders to gather feedback and insights from multiple perspectives.<br><br>- Site visits: Observing the current system in action to gain insights into how it is used and what can be improved. |
| Outputs | - Use cases: Detailed descriptions of how users interact with the system to accomplish specific tasks.<br><br>- User stories: Short, simple descriptions of a feature or requirement from the perspective of the user.<br><br>- Stakeholder requirements: A list of requirements gathered from stakeholders that reflect their needs and expectations.<br><br>- Requirements traceability matrix: A document that links requirements to their source and verifies that all requirements have been captured. |

## Techniques to Elicit Requirements

Sure, here's a table summarizing the techniques to elicit requirements in the context of an academic course registration system:

| Technique | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Interviewing](p6-interview.md) | Conducting formal or informal interviews with stakeholders can help gather information on their needs, expectations, and pain points related to the academic course registration system. This can involve one-on-one or group interviews with stakeholders, and can be conducted in-person, over the phone, or via video conference. |
| Scenarios | Creating scenarios or real-life examples can help stakeholders envision how the academic course registration system will work in practice. This can involve creating a step-by-step description of how a user would interact with the system to complete a task, and can help identify potential issues or areas for improvement. |
| Use Cases | Developing use cases is fundamental in UML and involves creating detailed descriptions of how users will interact with the academic course registration system to accomplish specific tasks. This can help identify requirements related to the system's functionality, and can be used to validate that the system meets the needs of its stakeholders. |
| Ethnography | Observing the operational process in the organization can provide valuable insights into how the academic course registration system will be used in practice. This can involve observing users interacting with the current system, as well as the wider organizational context in which the system operates. Ethnography can help identify requirements related to user behavior, organizational culture, and other factors that may influence the design and development of the system. |

### Scenarios

Scenarios are a technique used to elicit requirements by creating real-life examples of how the academic course registration system will be used in practice. Here's an example in the form of a table:

| Scenario | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Student Registration | A student wants to register for courses for the upcoming semester. The student logs into the system and searches for available courses based on their degree program and schedule. Once they have identified the courses they want to take, the student adds them to their course schedule and pays any necessary fees. The system confirms the student's registration and provides them with a copy of their course schedule. |
| Course Catalog Management | An administrator wants to update the course catalog to reflect changes in course offerings and requirements. The administrator logs into the system and navigates to the course catalog management section. They update course information, such as the course title, description, prerequisites, and schedule. The system validates the changes and updates the course catalog accordingly. |
| Grade Entry and Management | A professor wants to enter grades for their students at the end of the semester. The professor logs into the system and navigates to the grade entry section. They select the course they want to enter grades for and are presented with a list of students enrolled in the course. The professor enters grades for each student and the system calculates final grades based on the grading criteria. The system then stores the grades in the student's record and sends notifications to students who have completed the course. |

By creating scenarios like these, stakeholders can better understand how the academic course registration system will work in practice, and developers can identify requirements related to system functionality, usability, and other factors that may impact user experience.

Additional details about how the Student Registration scenario can be used to elicit requirements:

| Requirement Area | Example Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| User Interface | - The system should have a clear and intuitive interface for students to search for courses<br>- The system should provide instructions on how to add courses to a student's schedule |
| Course Availability | - The system should accurately display the courses available for a particular semester<br>- The system should provide information about course prerequisites, enrollment limits, and any other restrictions |
| Payment Processing | - The system should be able to securely process student payments<br>- The system should provide confirmation of payment to the student |
| Confirmation and Communication | - The system should provide the student with a confirmation of their registration<br>- The system should send notifications to the student about any changes to their course schedule or other relevant information |

By using the Student Registration scenario to elicit requirements, the development team can ensure that the academic course registration system meets the needs of its users and provides a seamless and efficient registration process.

## Use case

Use cases are a commonly used technique to elicit requirements in software engineering. A use case is a description of a specific interaction between a user or system and the software being developed. Use cases help to identify and clarify the different functionalities that the system needs to provide in order to meet the needs of its users.

In the context of the student registration scenario in an academic course registration system, some possible use cases might include:

1. Search for courses: A student can search for courses based on their degree program, course schedule, or other criteria.
2. Add course to schedule: A student can add a course to their schedule once they have found a suitable course.
3. Drop course from schedule: A student can drop a course from their schedule if they no longer wish to take the course.
4. Pay fees: A student can pay the fees associated with their course schedule.
5. View course schedule: A student can view their course schedule once they have added courses to it.
6. Confirm registration: The system confirms a student's registration once they have successfully added courses to their schedule and paid any necessary fees.

By identifying and describing these use cases, the development team can gain a better understanding of the system's requirements and ensure that the system is designed and implemented to meet those requirements.

### Basic structure of a use case diagram

The basic structure of a use case diagram for the student registration scenario in an academic course registration system.

A use case diagram typically consists of **actors**, **use cases**, and **relationships between them**. In this scenario, the actor would be the student and the use cases would be the actions they can perform in the system. 

The use cases identified in the previous response (search for courses, add course to schedule, drop course from schedule, pay fees, view course schedule, confirm registration) would be represented as oval shapes in the diagram. The actor (student) would be represented as a stick figure. 

The relationships between the actor and use cases would be represented as lines with arrows pointing from the actor to the use cases they can perform. For example, there would be a line with an arrow pointing from the student to the "search for courses" use case to indicate that the student can perform that action.

Overall, the use case diagram would provide a visual representation of the system's functionality and the roles of the different actors involved in the student registration process.

### Actors, use cases, and relationships

A description of the actors, use cases, and their relationships in a table format for the student registration scenario in an academic course registration system:

| Actors | Use Cases | Relationships |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Student | Search for courses<br>Add course to schedule<br>Drop course from schedule<br>Pay fees<br>View course schedule<br>Confirm registration | The student interacts with the system to search for courses, add them to their schedule, drop them from their schedule, pay fees, view their schedule, and confirm their registration. |
| Course Catalog System | Retrieve course information | The course catalog system provides course information to the student during the course search process. |
| Payment System | Process student payments | The payment system processes the student's payment for their registered courses. |
| Registration System | Confirm student registration | The registration system confirms the student's registration and provides them with a copy of their course schedule. |

This table provides a summary of the actors involved in the system, the use cases they interact with, and the relationships between them.

## Ethnography
Ethnography is a research technique that involves observing and analyzing the social interactions, behaviors, and culture of individuals or groups within a specific context. It is often used in anthropology and sociology, but can also be applied in the field of software engineering for requirements elicitation.

In the context of the Student Registration scenario in an academic course registration system, ethnography could involve observing the registration process in person, such as by shadowing a student as they navigate the system. This would allow the observer to gain a deeper understanding of the student's motivations, behaviors, and pain points in the registration process. The observer could also conduct interviews with students and other stakeholders to gather more information and insights.

The benefits of using ethnography in requirements elicitation include gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the user's perspective, identifying potential issues or barriers that may not be apparent through other techniques, and generating new ideas for system features or improvements.

However, there are also some limitations to using ethnography, such as the potential for observer bias and the time and resource-intensive nature of the technique. It may not be feasible or practical to conduct ethnographic research for all aspects of the requirements elicitation process, but it can be a valuable supplement to other techniques.

Here are some examples based on the academic course registration system case study:

1. User Stories:
    - As a student, I want to be able to search for courses based on my degree program and schedule, so that I can find courses that fit my needs.
    - As a student, I want to be able to add courses to my schedule and pay any necessary fees, so that I can register for courses for the upcoming semester.
    - As an administrator, I want to be able to view and manage course offerings, so that I can ensure that the courses are available and up-to-date.

2. Use Cases:
    - Search Courses: This use case allows a student to search for courses based on their degree program and schedule.
    - Register for Courses: This use case allows a student to register for courses for the upcoming semester by adding them to their course schedule and paying any necessary fees.
    - Manage Course Offerings: This use case allows an administrator to view and manage the course offerings, including adding or removing courses and updating course information.

3. Scenarios:
    - Student Registration: A student logs into the system and searches for available courses based on their degree program and schedule. Once they have identified the courses they want to take, the student adds them to their course schedule and pays any necessary fees. The system confirms the student's registration and provides them with a copy of their course schedule.
    - Course Management: An administrator logs into the system and views the current course offerings. They notice that a course is no longer available and remove it from the system. They also update the course information for another course to reflect changes in the curriculum. The system confirms the changes and updates the course offerings accordingly.

## Requirements validation
Requirements validation is a process that ensures the requirements are complete, correct, and consistent with the stakeholders' needs and the system's goals. It is a critical step in the requirements engineering process as it helps in identifying and resolving any discrepancies, errors, or ambiguities in the requirements before the design and development process begins. In the context of the academic course registration system case study, requirements validation would involve reviewing and verifying the identified requirements to ensure they accurately reflect the system's functionality and meet the stakeholders' expectations.

A table outlining the stages and methods of requirements validation in the context of an academic course registration system:

| Stage | Description | Methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements Review | A formal review of the requirements with stakeholders to identify and resolve any ambiguities, inconsistencies, or gaps. | - Peer reviews<br>- Walkthroughs<br>- Inspections |
| Prototyping | Developing a working prototype to test and refine the requirements. | - Interactive prototypes<br>- Simulation models<br>- Mock-ups |
| Testing | Verifying that the system meets the specified requirements through testing. | - Unit testing<br>- Integration testing<br>- System testing<br>- Acceptance testing |
| Demonstration | Presenting the system to stakeholders to demonstrate that the requirements have been met. | - User demonstrations<br>- Operational demonstrations<br>- Performance demonstrations |

Note that these are not the only methods for requirements validation, but they are common techniques used in software development. The specific methods chosen will depend on the project, the stakeholders involved, and the resources available.

Requirements validation is an essential step in the requirements engineering process as it ensures the identified requirements accurately reflect the system's functionality and meet the stakeholders' expectations. The validation process involves reviewing, testing, and verifying the requirements to ensure they are complete, correct, and consistent with the system's goals.

## Requirements reviews
Requirements reviews are an important step in the software development process that ensure the accuracy and completeness of the software requirements document (SRD). The reviews involve a careful analysis of the SRD to identify any errors, omissions, or inconsistencies that could potentially impact the quality of the final product. There are several types of requirements reviews, including:

1. Peer Reviews: In this type of review, a group of peers, including developers, testers, and project managers, analyze the SRD to identify any potential issues and suggest improvements.

2. Walkthroughs: A walkthrough involves a step-by-step review of the SRD with a team of experts, including domain experts, system architects, and developers. The walkthrough helps identify any areas where the SRD is unclear or ambiguous and ensures that all stakeholders understand the requirements.

3. Inspections: An inspection is a more formal type of review that involves a team of experts, including project managers, developers, and domain experts. The team carefully examines the SRD to identify any potential issues and make recommendations for improvements.

4. Testing: Testing is another important requirement review technique that involves verifying that the system requirements are complete, accurate, and testable. This technique involves creating test cases that verify that the system meets the specified requirements.

In an academic course registration system, requirements reviews can be used to ensure that the SRD accurately reflects the needs of students, faculty, and administrators. The reviews can help identify potential issues with the system, such as registration errors, course conflicts, or payment processing problems, and suggest improvements to enhance the user experience.

The table below summarizes the different types of requirements reviews and their key characteristics:

| Type of Review | Description | Participants |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Peer Reviews | Informal review by peers to identify potential issues and suggest improvements. | Developers, testers, project managers |
| Walkthroughs | Step-by-step review of the SRD with experts to identify areas that are unclear or ambiguous. | Domain experts, system architects, developers |
| Inspections | Formal review by a team of experts to identify potential issues and make recommendations for improvements. | Project managers, developers, domain experts |
| Testing | Verification that the system requirements are complete, accurate, and testable. | Testers, developers, project managers |

Review checks are a set of activities that are conducted during the requirements review process to ensure that the software requirements document (SRD) is complete, correct, and consistent. The purpose of review checks is to identify and correct any errors, inconsistencies, or ambiguities in the SRD before the development process begins. 

Review Checks for the academic course registration system:

| Review Check | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| Completeness | Ensures that all necessary requirements have been included in the document | Check that the SRD includes requirements for student login, course search, course registration, payment processing, and confirmation of registration |
| Consistency | Ensures that requirements are not contradictory or conflicting with each other | Check that the SRD specifies that students can only register for courses that fit within their degree program and schedule |
| Clarity | Ensures that requirements are stated clearly and unambiguously | Check that the SRD uses clear language and avoids technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to stakeholders |
| Testability | Ensures that requirements can be tested to verify that they have been met | Check that the SRD includes specific acceptance criteria for each requirement, such as "the system shall allow students to search for courses by course code or title" |
| Traceability | Ensures that requirements can be traced back to their origin and are not redundant | Check that each requirement in the SRD is linked to a specific stakeholder need or business objective, and that there are no duplicate requirements or requirements that overlap with each other |

By conducting these review checks, the requirements review process can identify and correct any errors, inconsistencies, or ambiguities in the SRD, which can help to improve the quality of the software development process.

## Requirements management

Requirements management is the process of systematically organizing, documenting, and controlling changes to the requirements of a system. The goal of requirements management is to ensure that the requirements are complete, consistent, and traceable throughout the development lifecycle.

In the case of an academic course registration system, requirements management would involve the following activities:

1. Requirements identification: The first step is to identify all the requirements for the system. This could involve reviewing existing documentation, interviewing stakeholders, and using other techniques such as scenarios and use cases.

2. Requirements documentation: Once the requirements have been identified, they need to be documented in a clear and concise manner. The IEEE Software Requirements Document (SRD) is one example of a document that can be used to capture and describe the requirements.

3. Requirements traceability: It is important to maintain traceability between the requirements and other artifacts such as design documents, test cases, and code. This ensures that any changes to the requirements are tracked and the impact on other artifacts can be assessed.

4. Requirements prioritization: Not all requirements are created equal, and it is important to prioritize them based on factors such as their importance to the system and their complexity.

5. Requirements change management: As the system is developed, there may be changes to the requirements. It is important to have a process in place for managing these changes, including evaluating their impact, documenting them, and communicating them to stakeholders.

6. Requirements validation: Once the requirements have been documented and changes have been managed, it is important to validate that they meet the needs of the stakeholders and the system as a whole. This could involve reviewing the requirements with stakeholders, performing testing, and other techniques.

7. Requirements verification: Finally, it is important to verify that the system has been developed to meet the requirements. This could involve testing, inspections, and other techniques to ensure that the system functions as expected.

By following these steps, requirements management ensures that the system meets the needs of the stakeholders and is delivered on time and within budget.

An example of how requirements management can be applied to our case study on an academic course registration system:

| Requirement | Priority | Status | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Students must be able to search for courses based on degree program and schedule. | High | Approved |
| Students must be able to add courses to their schedule and pay necessary fees. | High | Approved |
| System must confirm student's registration and provide a copy of their course schedule. | High | Approved |
| System must be available 24/7 to allow students to register at any time. | Medium | Approved |
| System must have a user-friendly interface that is easy for students to navigate. | High | Approved |
| Students must receive notifications if a course they have added to their schedule is cancelled or changed. | Medium | Approved |
| System must allow students to drop courses and receive a refund within a certain deadline. | High | Approved |
| System must keep track of student's academic history and progress towards degree completion. | Medium | Approved |
| System must be able to generate reports on course enrollment, student progress, and other metrics. | Low | Approved |
| System must comply with all applicable laws and regulations related to student privacy and data protection. | High | Approved |

In this example, we have identified several requirements for the academic course registration system, assigned priorities to each requirement, and indicated the status of each requirement as "approved." As the project progresses, these requirements may be updated, added to, or modified as needed, and their status should be updated accordingly. A requirements management plan should be in place to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of any changes or updates to the requirements, and that they are involved in the decision-making process.

## Changing Requirements

Changing requirements refer to modifications or alterations to the software requirements document during the software development lifecycle. These changes can occur due to various reasons such as changes in business requirements, changes in technology, new regulatory requirements, or changes in stakeholder expectations.

In the case of an academic course registration system, changing requirements could arise due to changes in the academic program structure, new courses being offered, changes in academic policies, or new regulations related to student information management.

To manage changing requirements, a formal change control process should be in place. This process typically includes the following steps:

1. Request for change: Any stakeholder who identifies the need for a change in requirements should formally submit a request for change.
2. Impact analysis: The impact of the proposed change on the software development process, project timeline, and budget should be analyzed.
3. Approval: The change request should be reviewed and approved by all relevant stakeholders.
4. Documentation: The change request and its impact analysis should be documented and tracked for future reference.
5. Implementation: The change should be implemented in the software requirements document and communicated to the development team.
6. Testing: The impact of the change on the software should be tested to ensure that it does not adversely affect the existing functionality.
7. Validation: The change should be validated with the stakeholders to ensure that it meets their requirements.

By following a formal change control process, changing requirements can be managed effectively and efficiently, ensuring that the software development process stays on track and meets the needs of all stakeholders involved.

An example of how changing requirements could be managed in an academic course registration system:

| Requirement Change | Proposed Solution | Impact Analysis | Approval Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Allow students to add or drop courses after the registration deadline | Add a late registration period with a fee for adding or dropping courses | Impact on course availability and scheduling, financial impact on students | Approved by Registrar's Office and Finance Department |
| Change course prerequisites for a specific program | Update the course description and prerequisites in the system | Impact on program requirements and course sequencing | Approved by Department Chair and Academic Advising Office |
| Increase capacity for a popular course | Hire an additional instructor or move the course to a larger classroom | Impact on instructor workload and classroom availability | Approved by Department Chair and Provost's Office |
| Remove a course from the course offerings | Remove the course from the system and notify enrolled students | Impact on enrolled students and course availability in future semesters | Approved by Department Chair and Registrar's Office |
