# Task 1: Additional Notes

Task 1 requires you to create supplementary notes for one module, based on the provided lecture notes. You are allowed to use various resources such as ChatGPT, websites, articles, and books to generate these notes. [Module 1](./materials/sec02/mod1.md) can serve as an example of the type of additional notes that are required.

To create a record of your group and the desired module, please input the relevant information into this Google Sheets [section 01](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVamYLFglM-v4twd29Qi4-z1N5RqPQ5FpucFI0Qv-wI/edit?usp=sharing) or [section 02](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CXVsz0EJqPTc0nS7GggXjWV8f3SXR0l_kG_dLg1IO5M/edit?usp=sharing) file. You are required to provide the group name and the name of the module you wish to create in the designated fields.This task should be completed in a group of four students.
2. Save the file in the [materials/sec01](/materials/sec01) or [materials/sec02](/materials/sec02) folder and name it `modX.md`, where `X` refers to the module number.
3. Use only markdown files and you can utilize tools like https://stackedit.io/ or Visual Studio Code to create the notes.
