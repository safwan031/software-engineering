# Module 7: Object-Oriented Detailed Design 🤖

## Understanding the Relationship Between Analysis, Design, and Implementation 💡

- Software design is a creative activity. 🎨
- The stages of "software design and implementation" are :
    - The process of developing an executable software system. 🏗️
- Implementation is :
    - The process of executing the program design. ⚙️

## Object-Oriented Design Process 📏

- Involves developing several system models. 📐
- Requires a significant effort in terms of development and maintenance. 🧰
- Design models are important communication mechanisms. 🗣️

## Understanding Object-Oriented Design Principles 🚩

- Well-formed class:
    - Complete   : Has all necessary components (data and methods) ✅
    - Sufficient : Has only necessary components (no excess) ✅
    - Cohesive   : Related components that work together ✨

## Design Principles

- Encapsulation         : Each object is a self-contained unit containing both data and program logic 📐
- Object reuse          : Standard objects can be used over and over again within a system ⚙️
- Information hiding    : Data associated with an object is not visible 📐
- Navigation visibility : Describes which objects can interact with each other ⚙️
- Coupling              : Measures how closely classes are linked 📐
- Cohesion              : Measures the consistency of functions in a class ⚙️

## High Cohesion
- Can be achieved if most of the interaction is within subsystems, rather than across subsystem boundaries

## Low Coupling
- Can be achieved if a calling class or interface does not need to know anything about the internals of the called class

## OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN MODELS USING UML
- Design model elaborates on the analysis model with technical solutions.
- Design model includes the same components as the analysis model, but with more fully formed artifacts and implementation details.
- An analysis class may only be a sketch with few attributes and key operations.
- A design class must be fully specified with all attributes and operations, including return types and parameter
