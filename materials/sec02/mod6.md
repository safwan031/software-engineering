# ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN and Detailed Design
## Recap on Design Stage

## Architecture Analogy for Software vs. House?

Software and houses can be compared in terms of architecture, as both require careful planning and construction to ensure that they are functional, secure, and meet the needs of their users.

In the case of software, the "blueprint" is the code, which must be carefully written and organized to ensure that the program runs smoothly and without errors. Like an architect designing a building, a software engineer must take into account factors such as scalability, maintainability, and user experience.

Similarly, a house requires a blueprint or plan, which takes into account factors such as layout, materials, and structural integrity. A good architect will also consider factors such as energy efficiency, safety, and aesthetics when designing a house.

In both cases, the finished product must be tested and inspected to ensure that it meets the desired standards. Software must be tested for bugs and functionality, while a house must be inspected for structural soundness and safety.

Ultimately, both software and houses require careful planning, attention to detail, and skilled craftsmanship to create a functional and reliable product.

## From Analysis to Design: Design Artefacts Metamodel

‚Ä¢ Design model contains exactly one design system that 
contains many design subsystems (also known as 
‚Äúpackage‚Äù that can also be introduced in the analysis) <br>

## Relationships between Analysis and  Design (Model and System)

‚Ä¢ The analysis and design models have a straightforward relationship, where the design model is an elaboration and refinement of the analysis model. <br>
‚Ä¢ Similarly, there is a direct correspondence between the analysis system and the design system, with each analysis system having a corresponding design system. <br>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128198038/231027073-f9c2f9e9-a318-4d1b-9ea0-57bbd9d1e903.jpg" width="300" height="200">

## Architectural Design: Design the Software Architecture

‚Ä¢ Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system should be organized and designing the overall structure of that system.  <br>
‚Ä¢ Architectural design is the critical link between design and requirements engineering, as it identifies the main structural components in a system and the 
relationships between them. <br>
‚Ä¢ The output of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components. <br>

## Design Use Case Realizations

‚Ä¢ Use case realizations offer a lower-level view <br>
‚Ä¢ Two-tiered focus:<br>
‚Äì Class interactions supporting a particular use case<br> 
‚Äì Interactions among software, users, and external systems <br>
‚Ä¢ Design typically spread over many iterations <br>

## Architectural Abstraction

‚Ä¢ Architecture in the small is concerned with the architecture of individual programs<br>
‚Äì Concerned with the way that an individual program is decomposed into components<br>
‚Ä¢ Architecture in the large is concerned with the architecture of complex enterprise systems that include other systems, programs, and program components<br>
‚Äì These enterprise systems are distributed over different computers, which may be owned and managed by different companies<br>

## Architectural Representations

‚Ä¢ The most common way for describing software architectures is through the use of straightforward, informal block diagrams that represent entities and relationships.
However, these have come under fire for lacking semantics, failing to depict the different kinds of links between entities, and failing to highlight the distinguishable characteristics of entities in the architecture.

‚Ä¢ Relies on how architectural models are utilised; how models are used determines the model semantics requirements.

## Box and Line Diagrams

‚Ä¢ Extremely abstract; they don't depict the nature of component interactions or the characteristics of the subsystems that may be seen from the outside.

‚Ä¢ Nonetheless, helpful for project planning and stakeholder communication.

## Use of Architectural Models

‚Ä¢ To facilitate conversation regarding the system's design.
- Because it is not cluttered with detail, a high-level architectural view of a system is helpful for communication with system stakeholders and project planning.
- Stakeholders can discuss the system as a whole without becoming bogged down in details since they can relate to it and comprehend an abstract perspective of it.

‚Ä¢ As a technique to preserve the design of an architecture.
- The goal is to create a full system model that displays all of the system's components, their interfaces, and their linkages.
  

# ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN DECISION 
## Architectural Design Decisions

Architectural design decisions refer to the choices made during the process of designing a building or structure. These decisions can have a significant impact on the functionality, aesthetics, and cost-effectiveness of the building.

Some examples of architectural design decisions include:

Building orientation: The orientation of a building can have a significant impact on its energy efficiency. For example, a building with large windows facing south can take advantage of natural sunlight to reduce the need for artificial lighting and heating.

Material selection: The choice of building materials can impact the durability, maintenance, and aesthetic of a building. For example, using sustainable materials such as bamboo or recycled steel can reduce the environmental impact of a building.
Space planning: The arrangement of spaces within a building can impact its functionality and efficiency. For example, designing an open floor plan can encourage collaboration and communication between occupants.

Structural system: The choice of structural system can impact the cost, speed of construction, and aesthetic of a building. For example, a steel frame structure can be faster and more cost-effective to build than a traditional masonry structure.

Building envelope: The design of the building envelope, including the roof, walls, and windows, can impact the building's energy efficiency, ventilation, and acoustics.

Sustainable design features: Incorporating sustainable design features such as green roofs, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems can reduce a building's environmental impact and operating costs.
Accessibility: Designing for accessibility ensures that a building can be used by people with a wide range of abilities. This includes features such as ramps, elevators, and wide doorways.


## Architecture Reuse 

Architecture reuse refers to the practice of using existing architectural designs, components, or systems in new construction projects. The goal of architecture reuse is to improve the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of construction by reducing the need for new designs and components.

Some examples of architecture reuse include:

Standardization of building components: Standardizing building components such as doors, windows, and HVAC systems can reduce design and construction time, as well as costs.

Modular construction: Modular construction involves the use of pre-fabricated modules or components that can be assembled on-site. This can reduce construction time, costs, and waste.

Adaptive reuse: Adaptive reuse involves the conversion of existing buildings or structures for new uses. This can reduce the need for new construction and preserve historic or culturally significant buildings.

Design libraries: Design libraries are collections of pre-designed architectural plans and components that can be used in new construction projects. This can reduce design time and costs, as well as ensure consistency and quality.

Building information modeling (BIM): BIM involves the use of digital models to design, construct, and manage buildings. BIM can facilitate architecture reuse by allowing designers to easily modify and reuse existing designs and components.

By promoting architecture reuse, construction projects can become more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable. This can also lead to greater consistency and quality in construction projects, as well as the preservation of historic and cultural landmarks.


## Architecture and System Characteristics (Non-Functional Requirements)

Architecture and system characteristics, also known as non-functional requirements, refer to the qualities or attributes that a software system or architecture should possess. These characteristics define how the system behaves or performs, rather than what it does. Here are some examples of architecture and system characteristics:

Performance: This refers to the ability of a system to process a large number of transactions or requests within a given time frame. Performance characteristics include throughput, response time, and scalability.

Security: This refers to the ability of a system to protect against unauthorized access or malicious attacks. Security characteristics include confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Reliability: This refers to the ability of a system to perform consistently and predictably under normal and abnormal conditions. Reliability characteristics include fault tolerance, recoverability, and availability.

Maintainability: This refers to the ability of a system to be easily modified, tested, and repaired. Maintainability characteristics include modularity, testability, and simplicity.

Usability: This refers to the ability of a system to be easily learned, used, and understood by its users. Usability characteristics include learnability, efficiency, and satisfaction.

Interoperability: This refers to the ability of a system to communicate and work with other systems or components. Interoperability characteristics include compatibility, adaptability, and portability.

Scalability: This refers to the ability of a system to handle increased workload or users without compromising performance or reliability.

## Architecture View

In software engineering, an architecture view refers to a high-level abstraction or representation of a software system's structure or components. It is a way to organize and understand the system's architecture by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

An architecture view typically consists of a set of diagrams, models, and descriptions that provide a comprehensive overview of the system's design and functionality. Each view may focus on a specific aspect of the system, such as the components, modules, interfaces, or deployment architecture.

The purpose of creating architecture views is to facilitate communication and collaboration among stakeholders, including developers, architects, and users. It helps them to understand the system's architecture, identify potential design issues, and make informed decisions about the system's development and maintenance.

Some common types of architecture views include the functional view, which describes the system's functional components and how they interact; the data view, which describes the system's data model and how data is stored and accessed; the deployment view, which describes the system's physical architecture and how components are distributed across hardware and software platforms; and the process view, which describes the system's operational processes and how they are executed.

## 4 + 1 View Model of Software Architecture

The 4 + 1 model of software engineering is a popular architectural model that provides a comprehensive view of software systems. It was proposed by Philippe Kruchten in 1995 and is often used in conjunction with the Rational Unified Process (RUP).

The 4 + 1 model consists of five architectural views or perspectives:

Logical View: This view describes the system's functionality in terms of modules, components, and their interactions. It defines the system's interfaces, abstractions, and relationships between various components.

Development View: This view describes the system's organization in terms of its development and implementation. It defines the development environment, tools, and processes required to build and maintain the system.

Process View: This view describes the system's runtime behavior in terms of its concurrency, synchronization, and communication. It defines the system's operational processes and how they interact with each other.

Physical View: This view describes the system's hardware and software architecture in terms of its deployment and distribution. It defines the system's hardware components, network topology, and software configuration.

Scenarios View: This view describes the system's behavior in response to different scenarios and use cases. It defines the system's external interfaces and how they interact with the system's internal components.

The "plus one" aspect of the 4 + 1 model refers to the use of scenarios as a cross-cutting view that provides a context for understanding the other four views. It helps to validate and verify the system's requirements and functionality by illustrating how the system behaves in different situations.

## UML Diagrams to Represent Architectural Views (4 + 1 View Model)

![] https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoftwareengineering.stackexchange.com%2Fquestions%2F233257%2Fmapping-between-41-architectural-view-model-uml&psig=AOvVaw2_vARC1J26Tuyz2uDV1CVy&ust=1681025287149000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCNC7m63hmf4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD

The 4 + 1 model does not prescribe a specific set of UML diagrams for each architectural view, but rather suggests a set of views and documentation that can be represented using various UML diagrams. However, here are some examples of UML diagrams that could be used to represent each architectural view:

Logical View:
Class Diagrams: Shows the classes, interfaces, attributes, and methods that make up the system's logical architecture.
Package Diagrams: Shows the organization of the system's components into packages and their dependencies.
Sequence Diagrams: Shows how messages are exchanged between objects and the sequence of actions that take place during a use case.
Development View:
Component Diagrams: Shows the system's components and how they are deployed across different machines or nodes.
Deployment Diagrams: Shows the physical architecture of the system and the hardware and software components used.
Package Diagrams: Shows the organization of the system's components into packages and their dependencies.
Process View:
Activity Diagrams: Shows the system's processes and how they are executed.
State Machine Diagrams: Shows the system's states and the events that trigger state transitions.
Interaction Diagrams: Shows how different components and processes interact with each other.
Physical View:
Deployment Diagrams: Shows the physical architecture of the system and the hardware and software components used.
Component Diagrams: Shows the system's components and how they are deployed across different machines or nodes.
Package Diagrams: Shows the organization of the system's components into packages and their dependencies.
Scenarios View:
Use Case Diagrams: Shows the system's use cases and the actors that interact with them.
Activity Diagrams: Shows the flow of actions and decisions during a use case scenario.
Sequence Diagrams: Shows how messages are exchanged between objects and the sequence of actions that take place during a use case.

## Relationship between Implementation Model and Design Model

The implementation model and design model are closely related as the implementation model is derived from the design model. The design model defines the architecture of the system, which includes the structure, behavior, and interactions between its components. The implementation model, on the other hand, is the actual implementation of the design model in code.

The design model specifies the high-level details of the system's architecture, including its components, modules, interfaces, and interactions. It also defines the relationships between these components and the overall structure of the system. The implementation model, however, provides the low-level details of how the system is actually built and implemented in code. This includes the actual implementation of the components, modules, and interfaces, as well as the code that defines the interactions between them.

In other words, the design model specifies what needs to be done, while the implementation model specifies how it will be done. The implementation model is a detailed version of the design model that is used by developers to actually implement the system. The implementation model is typically created after the design model has been finalized and approved, and it is used as a blueprint for writing the actual code.

The implementation model may also inform changes to the design model. During implementation, developers may encounter issues or constraints that were not apparent in the design phase. These issues may require changes to the design model to ensure that the system can be implemented effectively. As such, the design model and the implementation model are closely related and may evolve together throughout the development process.

## Relationship between Design Subsystems and Implementation Subsytems

Design subsystems and implementation subsystems are closely related, as the design subsystems define the high-level structure and behavior of the system, while the implementation subsystems specify the actual components and modules that make up the system.

The design subsystems represent the logical grouping of related functionality within the system. They are typically defined based on the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, and they describe how the system should behave and what it should do. The design subsystems also specify the interfaces between the subsystems and how they interact with each other.

The implementation subsystems, on the other hand, represent the actual components and modules that are used to implement the system. They are typically defined based on the design subsystems, and they describe the physical structure of the system. The implementation subsystems specify the actual code, libraries, frameworks, and other components that are used to implement the functionality specified by the design subsystems.

In other words, the design subsystems define the "what" of the system, while the implementation subsystems define the "how." The design subsystems provide a high-level view of the system's structure and behavior, while the implementation subsystems provide a more detailed view of how the system is actually implemented.

During the implementation phase, developers typically start with the design subsystems and use them as a guide to create the implementation subsystems. They may also make adjustments to the design subsystems as they implement the system, based on practical considerations and technical constraints.

Overall, the relationship between design subsystems and implementation subsystems is one of translation and refinement. The design subsystems provide a high-level blueprint for the system, which is refined and translated into the actual code and components used to implement the system.

## UML Component Diagram

UML-Unified Modelling Language.

A UML component diagram is a type of diagram that **shows the structure** of a system or application in terms of its components and the relationships between them. Components are modular parts of the system that perform specific functions and can be assembled together to create the larger system. Here are some key elements that you might see in a UML component diagram:

**Components**: These are the building blocks of the system, representing the modular parts that perform specific functions. Each component can have its own interface, ports, and properties.

**Interfaces**: These define the methods and services that a component provides to other components or to the outside world. Interfaces can be depicted as a small circle on the edge of a component shape.

**Ports**: These are specific points on a component where connections can be made to other components or to the outside world. Ports can be depicted as small squares or circles on the edge of a component shape.

**Connectors**: These represent the relationships between components, showing how they communicate and interact with each other. Connectors can be depicted as lines with arrows or other symbols to show the direction of communication.

**Dependencies**: These show that one component depends on another component for its functionality. Dependencies can be depicted as dashed lines with an arrow pointing from the dependent component to the component it depends on.

**Deployment nodes**: These show the physical hardware or software environment in which the system or application is deployed. Deployment nodes can be depicted as boxes or clouds with the components deployed on them.

Overall, a UML component diagram provides *a high-level view of the system's structure, showing how the different components interact with each other and with the outside world*. It can be used to help design and communicate the system architecture to stakeholders and developers.

## Types of Interface in Components

In UML (Unified Modeling Language), interfaces are a way to define a contract or set of methods that a class or component must implement. In the context of components, there are two main types of interfaces:

Provided Interface: This interface specifies the services or operations that a component provides to its clients or other components that depend on it.

Required Interface: This interface specifies the services or operations that a component requires from other components to function properly.

The provided and required interfaces together form the interface of a component, which defines the set of services that the component provides to and requires from other components in a system. The interface of a component is a crucial part of its design, as it helps ensure that the component can interact with other components in a well-defined and consistent manner.

## Architectural Patterns

Architectural patterns are high-level, abstract design patterns that provide solutions to common problems that arise in software architecture. They are reusable solutions to design problems that can be applied to different systems or applications. These patterns help architects and designers to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable system by providing a proven set of guidelines and best practices. Patterns (also known as styles) are a means of representing, sharing and reusing knowledge.

## Common Architectural Patterns

-	Model-View-Controller (MVC)
-	Layered
-	Repository
-	Client-Server
-	Pipe and Filter

## Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. The goal of the MVC pattern is to provide a clean separation of concerns between these three components, improving the modularity and maintainability of the application.

The model : manages the system data and associate operation with the date

The view : manages how the data is presented to the user

The controller : manages user interaction and passes to the model and the view

## Organization of MVC

## Web Application Architecture Using MVC

Web application architecture using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a common approach for building scalable and maintainable web applications. The MVC pattern separates the application into three components: the model, the view, and the controller. Here's how this pattern can be applied to a web application architecture:

Model: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. In the context of a web application, the model would typically consist of a database or other data storage mechanism, and the logic for retrieving, storing, and manipulating data. The model should be designed to be reusable across different views and controllers.

View: The view represents the user interface of the application. In the context of a web application, the view would typically consist of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and would be responsible for presenting the data to the user. The view should be designed to be reusable across different controllers.

Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. In the context of a web application, the controller would typically consist of server-side code, such as PHP, Python, or Ruby on Rails. The controller would be responsible for receiving requests from the user, retrieving data from the model, and passing that data to the view for presentation to the user. The controller should be designed to be reusable across different views.

The flow of data in the MVC pattern for a web application is as follows: the user interacts with the view, which sends a request to the controller. The controller retrieves data from the model, performs any necessary processing, and passes the data to the view for presentation to the user.

By separating the application into these three components, the MVC pattern allows for a clear separation of responsibilities, making it easier to maintain and extend the application over time. The model can be updated independently of the view and controller, the view can be updated independently of the model and controller, and the controller can be updated independently of the model and view. This makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain each component of the application separately, which ultimately results in a more robust and maintainable application.

## Example : MVC Architecture Used for a Dashboard

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture can be used for a dashboard application in the following way:

Model: The model would be responsible for managing the data that is displayed on the dashboard. This could include data from multiple sources, such as databases, APIs, or other applications. The model would also be responsible for defining how the data can be manipulated, such as filtering, sorting, or aggregating data.

View: The view would be responsible for presenting the data to the user in a visual format, such as charts, tables, or graphs. The view would allow the user to interact with the data, such as selecting a date range or changing the type of chart being displayed.

Controller: The controller would act as an intermediary between the model and the view. It would receive input from the user through the view, such as selecting a date range, and then update the model accordingly. The controller would then update the view to reflect any changes made to the data.

The MVC architecture would allow for a clear separation of responsibilities between the different components of the dashboard application. This would make it easier to modify or extend the application without affecting the other components, and would also make it easier to maintain and understand the codebase. Additionally, the MVC architecture would allow for the reuse of components across different dashboards, improving the scalability and maintainability of the application.

## Layered Architecture

The layered architecture style is one of the most common architectural styles. The idea behind
Layered Architecture is that modules or components with similar functionalities are
organized into horizontal layers. As a result, each layer performs a specific role within the
application.

The layered architecture style does not have a restriction on the number of layers that the
application can have, as the purpose is to have layers that promote the concept of separation of
concerns. The layered architecture style abstracts the view of the system as a whole while
providing enough detail to understand the roles and responsibilities of individual layers and
the relationship between them. 

## Layered Architecture Pattern

The Layered Architecture pattern is a software architecture pattern that structures an application into separate layers that interact with each other in a hierarchical manner. Each layer provides a specific set of services to the layer above it and consumes services from the layer below it. The Layered Architecture pattern typically includes three layers:

Presentation Layer: This layer is responsible for providing the user interface to the application. It is the layer that interacts directly with the user, and its main responsibility is to present the data to the user in a meaningful way. This layer typically includes user interface components, such as forms, web pages, and views.

Business Layer: This layer is responsible for implementing the business logic of the application. It contains the application's rules and policies that govern the behavior of the application. This layer typically includes business components, such as services, managers, and controllers.

Data Layer: This layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data. It interacts with the application's data sources, such as databases, files, or web services. This layer typically includes data access components, such as repositories, DAOs (Data Access Objects), and gateways.

The main advantage of using the Layered Architecture pattern is that it provides a clear separation of concerns and a high degree of modularity, which makes it easier to maintain, test, and evolve the application. The separation of concerns also makes it easier to distribute the work among multiple developers or teams. Another advantage of the Layered Architecture pattern is that it allows for greater flexibility in choosing the implementation technology for each layer, which can lead to better performance, scalability, and reliability.

However, one potential downside of the Layered Architecture pattern is that it can lead to excessive coupling between layers, especially if the layers are not well defined and do not adhere to their responsibilities strictly. Another potential downside is that it can result in an increase in the number of layers, which can lead to an increase in complexity and difficulty in maintaining the application.

## Generic Layered Architecture

## Example : Architecture of iLearn System

Presentation layer : Browse-based user interface, iLearn app
Configuration services layer : Group management, Application management, Identity management
Application services layer : Email, Messaging, Video conferencing, Newspaper archive, Word processing, Simulation, Video storage, Resource finder, Spreadsheet, Virtual learning environment, History archive
Utility services layer : Authentication, Logging and monitoring, Interfacing, User storage, Application storage, Search

## Example : Architecture of Mentcare System

Presentation layer : Web browser, Login, Role checking, Form and menu manager, Data validation
Business layer : Security management, Patient information management, Data import and export Report generation
Data access layer : Transaction management, Patient database

## Three and Four Layer Architectures

Three layer architecture only consists of :
-	Presentation layer
-	Business logic layer
-	Database layer

But, business logic layer can be split into two layers which is application logic layer and domain layer, 

Therefore, four layer architecture consists of :
-	Presentation layer
-	Application logic layer
-	Domain layer
-	Database layer

## Example : Partitioned Subsytems in Four Layer Architecture

Partitioned subsystems is a loosely coupled subsystems, each delivering a sigle service or coherent group of services. 
Example of partitioned subsystems is an agate campaign management system.

## Repository Architecture

A repository architecture consists of a central data structure (often a database) and a collection of independent components which operate on the central data structure.
A sub-systems must exchange data that may be done in two ways :
-	Shared data is held in a central database or repository and may be accessed by all sub-systems.
-	Each sub-system maintains its own database and passes data explicitly to other sub-systems.
When large amounts of data are to be shared, the repository model of sharing is most commonly used as this is an efficient data sharing mechanism.

## Repository Pattern

The Repository pattern is a software architecture pattern that provides a way to isolate the application's business logic from the underlying data storage technology. It is a popular pattern for designing the data access layer of an application and is commonly used in conjunction with other patterns, such as the Layered Architecture pattern.

The Repository pattern is based on the principle of separation of concerns, where the data access logic is separated from the business logic of the application. The Repository acts as a mediator between the data source and the application, providing a clean and consistent interface for the application to interact with the data source. The Repository pattern also provides a way to centralize the data access logic, making it easier to maintain and modify the application.

The main components of the Repository pattern are:

-	Repository interface: This is an interface that defines the contract between the data access layer and the application. It defines the methods that the application can use to interact with the data source.
-	Repository implementation: This is the implementation of the Repository interface. It provides the implementation of the methods defined in the interface and interacts with the data source to retrieve or store data.
-	Data source: This is the underlying data storage technology, such as a database, file system, or web service.

The advantages of using the Repository pattern are:

-	Separation of concerns: The Repository pattern separates the data access logic from the application's business logic, making it easier to maintain and modify the application.
-	Centralized data access logic: The Repository pattern provides a way to centralize the data access logic, making it easier to maintain and modify the application.
-	Testability: The Repository pattern makes it easier to write unit tests for the application, as the data access logic is isolated from the application's business logic.
-	Flexibility: The Repository pattern provides a flexible way to interact with different data sources, as the data access logic is abstracted away from the underlying data storage technology.

The disadvantages of using the Repository pattern are:

-	Additional complexity: The Repository pattern adds an additional layer of complexity to the application, which can make it more difficult to understand and maintain.
-	Performance overhead: The Repository pattern can introduce performance overhead, especially if the data source is remote and the application needs to make multiple round trips to retrieve or store data.

Overall, the Repository pattern is a useful pattern for designing the data access layer of an application, as it provides a way to isolate the data access logic from the business logic of the application and centralizes the data access logic, making it easier to maintain and modify the application.

## Client-Server Architecture

The client-server architecture refers to a system that hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services that the client requests. In this model, all requests and services are delivered over a network, and it is also referred to as the networking computing model or client server network. 
A client-server architecture is a distributed system model which shows how data and processing is distributed across a range of components. It can be implemented on a single computer.
This type of architecture is a set of stand-alone servers which provide specific services such as printing, data management, etc. It has set of clients which call on these services and a network which allows the clients to access servers.

## Client-Server Pattern

Client-server architecture is a software architecture pattern that divides an application into two separate parts, a client and a server, which communicate with each other over a network. In this pattern, the client is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user and sending requests to the server, while the server is responsible for processing the requests and returning responses.

The client-server architecture pattern is widely used in distributed computing environments, where the client and server may be located on different computers, or even in different geographical locations. This pattern provides a way to distribute the processing load of an application across multiple servers, which can improve performance and scalability.

The main components of the client-server architecture pattern are:

-	Client: The client is the application or device that interacts with the user and sends requests to the server. The client can be a web browser, mobile app, desktop application, or any other application that communicates with the server.
-	Server: The server is the application or device that processes the requests from the client and sends responses back to the client. The server can be a web server, application server, database server, or any other server that provides services to the client.
-	Network: The network is the communication medium that connects the client and server. The network can be a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the internet.

The advantages of using the client-server architecture pattern are:

-	Scalability: The client-server architecture pattern provides a way to distribute the processing load of an application across multiple servers, which can improve performance and scalability.
-	Flexibility: The client-server architecture pattern provides a flexible way to design and develop applications, as the client and server can be developed independently and can be located on different platforms or devices.
-	Security: The client-server architecture pattern provides a way to implement security mechanisms, such as authentication and encryption, to protect the communication between the client and server.
-	Maintenance: The client-server architecture pattern provides a way to maintain and upgrade the application components independently, without affecting the other components.

The disadvantages of using the client-server architecture pattern are:

-	Network dependency: The client-server architecture pattern relies on the network to communicate between the client and server, which can introduce network latency and affect the application's performance.
-	Complexity: The client-server architecture pattern can be more complex than other architectures, as it involves multiple components and requires additional mechanisms, such as load balancing and caching, to manage the communication between the client and server.

Overall, the client-server architecture pattern is a useful pattern for designing distributed applications, as it provides a way to distribute the processing load across multiple servers, improve performance and scalability, and implement security mechanisms to protect the communication between the client and server.

## Pipe and Filter Architecture

Pipe and Filter is another architectural pattern, which has independent entities called filters (components) which perform transformations on data and process the input they receive, and pipes, which serve as connectors for the stream of data being transformed, each connected to the next component in the pipeline.
Functional transformations which process inputs to produce outputs and it may be referred to as a pipe and filter model (as in UNIX shell). Variants of this approach are very common. When transformations are sequential, this is a batch sequential model which is extensively used in data processing systems. This architecture is not really suitable for interactive systems.

## Pipe and Filter Pattern

The pipe and filter architecture pattern is a software architecture pattern that is used to process a stream of data. In this pattern, data flows through a series of filters that perform specific operations on the data. Each filter takes input data from a previous filter, performs its processing, and then passes the output data to the next filter in the pipeline. The filters are connected by pipes, which are used to transfer data from one filter to the next.

The main components of the pipe and filter architecture pattern are:

-	Pipes: Pipes are channels through which data is transferred from one filter to the next. Each filter has an input pipe and an output pipe.
-	Filters: Filters are software components that perform a specific operation on the data that passes through them. Examples of filters include parsers, sorters, converters, and validators.
-	Source: The source is the component that produces the data that is processed by the filters. The source can be a file, database, network stream, or any other source of data.
-	Sink: The sink is the component that receives the final output of the filter pipeline. The sink can be a file, database, network stream, or any other destination for the data.

The advantages of using the pipe and filter architecture pattern are:

-	Scalability: The pipe and filter architecture pattern can be easily scaled by adding more filters to the pipeline or by running multiple instances of the same filter in parallel.
-	Flexibility: The pipe and filter architecture pattern provides a flexible way to design and develop applications, as filters can be developed independently and can be combined in different ways to create different pipelines.
-	Reusability: Filters can be reused in different pipelines or in different applications, which can save development time and reduce maintenance costs.
-	Testability: Each filter can be tested independently, which makes it easier to identify and fix bugs in the pipeline.

The disadvantages of using the pipe and filter architecture pattern are:

-	Overhead: The pipe and filter architecture pattern can introduce additional overhead due to the communication between filters and the data transfer between pipes.
-	Performance: The performance of the pipeline can be affected by the processing time of each filter and the data transfer rate between filters.
-	Complexity: The pipe and filter architecture pattern can be more complex than other architectures, as it involves multiple components and requires additional mechanisms, such as synchronization and error handling, to manage the data flow between filters.

Overall, the pipe and filter architecture pattern is a useful pattern for processing streams of data, as it provides a way to create flexible and scalable pipelines of filters that can be combined in different ways to perform different operations on the data.
