## Scenario: Online Banking System

A banking organization is developing an Online Banking System to provide its customers with convenient and secure access to their accounts and banking services. The system follows the 4 + 1 View Model of software architecture to ensure a comprehensive and well-structured design.

### Logical View
The logical view of the Online Banking System focuses on the functional aspects of the system. It includes components such as user authentication, account management, funds transfer, bill payment, and transaction history. The logical view ensures that the system's functionality is well-organized and easy to maintain.

### Development View
The development view in the Online Banking System deals with the software development aspects. It encompasses programming languages, frameworks, databases, and development tools used to build the system. The development view ensures that the system is developed using industry best practices and enables collaboration among developers.

### Process View
The process view illustrates the dynamic behavior of the Online Banking System. It showcases the interactions between different components during runtime, such as user login, transaction processing, and security checks. The process view helps in understanding the system's behavior, performance, and scalability.

### Physical View
The physical view of the Online Banking System focuses on the deployment and distribution of system components. It includes hardware infrastructure, network configuration, servers, databases, and security measures. The physical view ensures that the system is deployed in an optimized and secure manner.

### Use Case View
The use case view identifies the functional requirements from the user's perspective. It captures various use cases such as customer registration, balance inquiry, fund transfer, bill payment, and account statement generation. The use case view helps in understanding the system's interactions with different user roles and their corresponding functionalities.
