# Case Study: Hospital Management System

## Problem Statement:
A hospital wants to develop a comprehensive Hospital Management System to streamline their administrative and medical processes. The system should include modules for patient management, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing and invoicing, and inventory management. The system should have an intuitive user interface and ensure data accuracy, security, and efficiency.

## Architectural Design:

| Component          | Description                                                                                   | Tool/Software Recommendation     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| User Interface     | Develop a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface should provide forms and pages for patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and inventory management. It should communicate with the backend components through REST APIs.                           | React, Angular, Vue.js            |
| Business Logic     | Implement the business logic using a server-side programming language like Java or Python. The logic should handle patient management, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and inventory management. It should enforce business rules, validate inputs, and coordinate operations between different modules. Use appropriate design patterns to maintain modularity and scalability. | Java Spring Boot, Django, Node.js |
| Data Access Logic  | Develop a data access layer to interact with the database. Use an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework like Hibernate or Django ORM to handle database operations. Implement methods to retrieve and store patient-related data, appointments, medical records, billing information, and inventory details.                           | Hibernate, Django ORM, Sequelize |
| Database           | Use a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle. Create tables to store patient information, appointments, medical records, billing details, and inventory records. Establish appropriate relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys for data integrity and efficient querying.                              | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle         |

## System Workflow:

- Hospital staff, such as receptionists and doctors, access the web-based user interface to perform various tasks.
- When registering a new patient, the user interface captures patient details and sends them to the backend through a REST API.
- The business logic component receives the patient data, performs validation, and instructs the data access logic to store the patient details in the database.
- For appointment scheduling, the user interface displays available slots, and upon selection, sends the appointment details to the backend. The business logic validates the appointment and instructs the data access logic to update the appointment schedule.
- Medical records management involves capturing patient diagnoses, treatments, and test results. The business logic coordinates with the data access logic to store and retrieve medical records from the database.
- For billing and invoicing, the business logic calculates charges based on treatments, medications, and other services provided. It interacts with the data access logic to store billing details and generate invoices.
- Inventory management involves tracking the availability of medical supplies, equipment, and medications. The business logic updates inventory records based on usage and communicates with the data access logic to ensure accurate inventory management.
- The user interface component displays patient details, appointment schedules, medical records, billing information, and inventory status to the hospital staff.
