# Case Study: Online Shopping Application

## Overview
An online shopping application is being developed to provide customers with a convenient way to browse and purchase products online. The application is designed using the 4 + 1 View Model of software architecture, which separates concerns into different views to ensure modularity and scalability. Let's explore the different views and their respective responsibilities in this case study.

### Logical View
The logical view of the application focuses on the functionality and behavior of the system. It includes components such as the shopping cart, product catalog, user authentication, and order processing. The logical view ensures that the application's functionality is well-organized and easy to maintain.

### Development View
The development view concentrates on the software development aspects of the application. It includes components like code modules, development tools, and libraries. The development view ensures that the application is built using best practices and facilitates collaboration among developers.

### Process View
The process view illustrates the dynamic behavior of the system. It describes how the different components interact with each other during runtime. In the case of the online shopping application, the process view would showcase the flow of activities when a user adds items to the cart, proceeds to checkout, and completes the purchase.

### Physical View
The physical view deals with the deployment and distribution of the system components. It includes hardware, network infrastructure, and the physical environment. In the case of the online shopping application, the physical view would describe the server architecture, load balancing mechanisms, and database servers.

### Use Case View
The use case view focuses on capturing the functional requirements of the system from the user's perspective. It identifies different use cases and how they interact with the system. For the online shopping application, typical use cases would be user registration, product search, and order placement.
