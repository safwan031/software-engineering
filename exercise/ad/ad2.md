# Case Study: Hospital Management System

## Overview
A Hospital Management System is being developed to streamline the operations and improve patient care in a healthcare facility. The system follows the 4 + 1 View Model of software architecture to ensure a modular and scalable design. Let's delve into the case study and explore various aspects of the system.

### Logical View
The logical view of the Hospital Management System focuses on the functional aspects of the system. It encompasses components such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and inventory management. The logical view ensures that the system's functionality is well-structured and easy to maintain.

### Development View
The development view in the Hospital Management System deals with the software development aspects. It includes components such as programming languages, frameworks, databases, and development tools. The development view ensures that the system is developed using industry best practices and facilitates collaboration among developers.

### Process View
The process view illustrates the dynamic behavior of the Hospital Management System. It showcases how different components interact during runtime. For instance, it captures the flow of activities when a patient schedules an appointment, undergoes medical procedures, and receives billing information. The process view helps in understanding the system's behavior and performance.

### Physical View
The physical view of the Hospital Management System focuses on the deployment and distribution of system components. It includes hardware infrastructure, network configuration, servers, and databases. The physical view ensures that the system is deployed in an optimized manner, considering factors such as scalability, reliability, and security.

### Use Case View
The use case view identifies the functional requirements from the user's perspective. It captures various use cases such as patient registration, appointment booking, medical report generation, and inventory management. The use case view helps in understanding the system's interactions with different user roles and their corresponding functionalities.
