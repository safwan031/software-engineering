# Case Study: E-commerce Platform

## Overview
An e-commerce platform is being developed to provide online shopping services to customers. The system follows the 4 + 1 View Model of software architecture to ensure a modular and scalable design. Let's explore the case study and answer the multiple-choice questions related to the architecture.

### Logical View
The logical view of the e-commerce platform focuses on the functional aspects of the system. It includes components such as product catalog management, shopping cart, order processing, payment gateway integration, and customer account management. The logical view ensures that the system's functionality is well-structured and easy to maintain.

### Development View
The development view in the e-commerce platform deals with the software development aspects. It includes components such as programming languages, frameworks, databases, and development tools. The development view ensures that the system is developed using industry best practices and facilitates collaboration among developers.

### Process View
The process view illustrates the dynamic behavior of the e-commerce platform. It showcases how different components interact during runtime, such as user authentication, product search, order placement, and payment processing. The process view helps in understanding the system's behavior and performance.

### Physical View
The physical view of the e-commerce platform focuses on the deployment and distribution of system components. It includes hardware infrastructure, network configuration, servers, databases, and load balancing mechanisms. The physical view ensures that the system is deployed in an optimized manner, considering factors such as scalability, reliability, and security.

### Use Case View
The use case view identifies the functional requirements from the user's perspective. It captures various use cases such as user registration, product browsing, adding items to the cart, placing an order, and tracking order status. The use case view helps in understanding the system's interactions with different user roles and their corresponding functionalities.
