# Case Study: VecInsured

>An insurance company wants to develop a system calls VecInsured to computerize its company vehicle insurance policy management. The VecInsured system should be able to add the information of a new vehicle, add information of a new driver and calculate the premium for the insurance. It should be able to check the validity of the insured vehicle information with the Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan (JPJ) system. The VecInsured system can also check if the insured vehicle has any summon with JPJ system. It also enables the customer to pay the insurance using credit card or online banking payment.

>‚ÄúAdd a new vehicle‚Äù is a use case in VecInsured system to add a new vehicle to an existing policy. A customer calls a clerk at the insurance company and gives his policy number. The clerk enters this information, and the system displays the basic insurance policy. The clerk then checks the information to make sure the premiums are current and the policy is active. The customer gives the make, model, year, and vehicle identification number (VIN) of the car to be added. The clerk enters this information, and the system ensures that the given data is valid. Next, the customer selects the types of coverage desired and the amount of each. The clerk enters the information, and the system records it and validates the requested amount against the policy limits. After all of the overages have been entered, the system ensures the total coverage against all other ranges, including other cars on the policy. Finally, the customer must identify all drivers and the percentage of time they drive the car.

Insured person is someone who purchases an insurance policy. The insurance policy consists of one or many insured persons and one or many insured vehicles. An insured vehicle can have a summon history. There are two coverage types offered by the insurance policy that are standard and comprehensive coverage.
