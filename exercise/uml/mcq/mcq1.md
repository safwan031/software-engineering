## Case Study: Introduction
An online bookstore system is a web-based application that allows users to browse and purchase books online. The system provides features such as searching for books, adding them to a shopping cart, and completing the purchase transaction. The system consists of two main actors: User and Admin. Users can search for books based on various criteria, view book details, add books to their cart, manage the cart contents, and proceed to checkout. Admins are responsible for managing the book inventory and user accounts. They can add, update, or remove books from the system's inventory and manage user registration, login, and account deletion.

## Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram illustrates the interactions between actors and the system's functionality. It showcases use cases such as "Search Books," "View Book Details," "Add to Cart," "Manage Cart," and "Checkout" for the User actor. The Admin actor has use cases like "Manage Inventory" and "Manage Users."

## Activity Diagram
The activity diagram represents the flow of activities within the system. It showcases the steps involved in processes such as searching for books, adding books to the cart, managing the cart contents, and completing the checkout process.

## Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram depicts the interaction between objects over time. It illustrates the sequence of messages exchanged between objects during processes such as searching for books, adding them to the cart, and completing the purchase transaction.

## System Description
The online bookstore system enables users to search for books by title, author, or genre. Upon selecting a book, users can view detailed information such as the book's description, price, and availability. They can add books to their shopping cart for purchase and manage the contents of the cart by adding or removing items. When ready, users can proceed to checkout and complete the purchase transaction.

Admins have access to additional functionality. They can manage the book inventory by adding new books, updating existing book details, or removing books from the system. Admins are also responsible for managing user accounts, including user registration, login, and account deletion.
