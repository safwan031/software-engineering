# Case Study: Online Shopping System

## Introduction
An Online Shopping System enables users to browse and purchase products from various vendors through a web-based platform. The system provides functionality for users to search for products, add them to a shopping cart, proceed to checkout, and complete the purchase transaction. It also allows vendors to manage their inventory, process orders, and track sales. Let's explore the system requirements and model them using Structural and Behavioral UML diagrams.

## Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram showcases the interactions between actors and the system's functionality. It includes use cases such as "Search Products," "Add to Cart," "Proceed to Checkout," "Process Order," and "Manage Inventory" for both users and vendors.

## Class Diagram
The class diagram represents the structure and relationships between classes and their attributes in the Online Shopping System. It includes classes such as "User," "Vendor," "Product," "Shopping Cart," "Order," and "Payment," along with their associations and multiplicity.

## Activity Diagram
The activity diagram depicts the flow of activities within the system. It showcases the steps involved in processes such as searching for products, adding items to the shopping cart, proceeding to checkout, and processing orders.

## Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between objects over time. It showcases the sequence of messages exchanged between objects during processes such as adding items to the shopping cart, completing the checkout process, and processing orders.

## System Description
The Online Shopping System involves two main actors: Users and Vendors. Users are the individuals who browse and purchase products, while Vendors are the sellers who offer products for sale.

The main functionality of the system includes:

1. **Search Products**: Users can search for products based on various criteria such as keywords, categories, or price range.
2. **Add to Cart**: Users can add selected products to their shopping cart for later purchase.
3. **Proceed to Checkout**: Users can review the items in their cart, enter shipping and payment details, and proceed to complete the purchase.
4. **Process Order**: Vendors receive orders placed by users, update inventory, and arrange shipment.
5. **Manage Inventory**: Vendors can add new products, update existing product details, and track inventory levels.
6. **Track Sales**: Vendors can generate reports to analyze sales data and monitor their business performance.

The Online Shopping System aims to provide a seamless and convenient shopping experience for users while offering a platform for vendors to showcase and sell their products effectively.
