# Case Study: Library Management System

## Introduction
A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application that automates the management of library resources, including books, magazines, and other materials. The LMS provides functionality for library staff and patrons to perform tasks such as searching for books, borrowing and returning items, managing user accounts, and generating reports. Let's explore the system requirements and model them using UML diagrams.

## Use Case Diagram
The use case diagram represents the interactions between actors and the system's functionality. It showcases use cases such as "Search Books," "Borrow Item," "Return Item," "Manage User Account," and "Generate Reports" for both library staff and patrons.

## Activity Diagram
The activity diagram depicts the flow of activities within the system. It showcases the steps involved in processes such as searching for books, borrowing and returning items, managing user accounts, and generating reports.

## Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between objects over time. It showcases the sequence of messages exchanged between objects during processes such as borrowing and returning items.

## System Description
The Library Management System involves two main actors: Library Staff and Patrons. Library Staff is responsible for managing the library's collection, while Patrons are the individuals who borrow and return items.

The main functionality of the system includes:

1. **Search Books**: Both library staff and patrons can search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, or category.
2. **Borrow Item**: Patrons can borrow books by selecting the desired item and providing their library account details.
3. **Return Item**: Patrons can return borrowed items by submitting them to the library staff.
4. **Manage User Account**: Patrons can manage their account details, including updating personal information and viewing borrowing history.
5. **Manage Library Collection**: Library staff can add new books, update existing book details, and remove items from the library collection.
6. **Generate Reports**: Library staff can generate reports on various aspects, such as borrowing statistics, overdue items, and popular books.

The Library Management System aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for patrons to access library resources, borrow items seamlessly, and facilitate effective library management for staff.
