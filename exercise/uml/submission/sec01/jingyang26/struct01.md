## Answer
Q1: The most suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency is the Agile software development model. Agile methodology is well-suited for projects with changing requirements and a need for flexibility, which is often the case in web-based applications where client preferences and market trends can evolve rapidly.The Agile software development model is the most suitable choice for the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency due to its flexibility, adaptability, emphasis on customer collaboration, incremental delivery, rapid prototyping, and continuous improvement. It enables the development team to respond effectively to changing requirements, deliver value early, and ensure a system that aligns with the agency's evolving needs.

Q2: Functional Requirements:
1.User Registration: The system should allow users to register an account with their personal details, such as name, email address, and contact information, to create a unique profile for accessing the online tour reservation system.</d>
2.Tour Search and Booking: The system should provide a search functionality for users to browse available tours based on various criteria, such as destination, date, duration, and price range. </d>
3.Reservation Management: The system should enable users to view and manage their tour reservations. Users should be able to view their upcoming and past reservations, make changes to their bookings (e.g., update participant information or change tour dates if allowed), and cancel reservations if necessary.</d>
Non-Functional Requirements:
1.Security: The system should prioritize the security of user information and transactions. It should incorporate robust authentication mechanisms to protect user accounts, utilize secure protocols for data transmission, and store sensitive data (such as payment details) securely using encryption.</d>
2.Performance and Scalability: The system should be designed to handle a high volume of concurrent users and tour bookings. It should provide responsive and fast performance, ensuring that users can search for tours, make reservations, and access their booking details without significant delays. Additionally, the system should be scalable to accommodate increasing user traffic and tour offerings as the business grows.</d>
