## Answer
1. Agile Software Process Model. In this model, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
   This is important as some of the customer might be unsatisfied with some of the interface and with this model, changes can be made during the process as the all the process are not fixed.
   Not only that, the cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced. The amount of analysis and documentation that has to be redone is much less than is required with the waterfall model.
