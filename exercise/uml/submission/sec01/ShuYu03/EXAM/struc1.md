## Answer
1. Incremental Development Model should be used to develope the proposed online tour reservation system for Citraâ€™s travel agency. This is because the specification, development, and validation stage are interleaved. During the early increment, the stakeholder prior requirement can be identified and the later increment will depend on stakeholders. This can ensure the development team get immediate feedback from customer in each increment to meet their needs. Besides, incremental development model also help in reduce cost for accomodating change and ensure rapid delivery of the developed system.
