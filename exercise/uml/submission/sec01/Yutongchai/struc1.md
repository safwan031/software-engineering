## Answer
1. The most suitable fostware process model in developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency is Agile Scrum Model. It is because agile scrum follows an iterative and incremental approach, allowing the development team to deliver working software in short iterations or sprints. This aligns well with the project's requirement to provide online reservation functionality and tours information to clients. Hence the system can be developed in increments, starting with essential features and then adding more functionality in subsequent sprints.
2. Functional requirements
   a. *User Registration*
      The system should allow prospective clients to register as users, providing necessary personal information and creating a login ID and password.
   b. *Tour Registration*
      Registered users should be able to make tour reservations online, selecting their desired tour, specifying the number of participants, and providing relevant details like dates, preferences, and any special requirements.
   c. *Reservation Cancellation*
      Users should have the ability to cancel their previously made reservations, ensuring a seamless and straightforward process.
   Non-functional requirements
   a. *Security*
      The system should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of user data, including login credentials and personal information.
   b. *Performance*
      The system should be able to handle a significant number of concurrent users, providing a responsive and efficient user experience even during peak hours.
