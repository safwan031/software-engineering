## Software Process Model Selection - Citra Tours & Travel Agency

Based on the given requirements for developing the online tour reservation system for Citra Tours & Travel Agency, the most suitable software process model would be the Agile development model. The Agile model is characterized by its iterative and incremental approach, focusing on delivering working software in short iterations and adapting to changing requirements throughout the development process. Here are the reasons for choosing the Agile model:

1. Customer Collaboration: The Agile model emphasizes collaboration and interaction with customers (in this case, the agency and the clients). It allows for continuous feedback and involvement of stakeholders throughout the development process. This is crucial for understanding and incorporating their changing requirements, ensuring that the system meets their needs effectively.

2. Quick and Iterative Delivery: Agile development follows a time-boxed iterative approach, where the development is divided into small iterations or sprints. Each sprint results in a working increment of the software that can be demonstrated to the stakeholders. This allows for early and continuous delivery of valuable functionality, which is important for the agency to start using and providing feedback on the system's core features.

3. Adaptability to Changing Requirements: The Agile model acknowledges that requirements can evolve and change over time. In this project, there might be modifications or additional features requested by the agency or the clients during the development process. Agile allows for flexibility and easy incorporation of changes as it embraces change as a natural part of software development.

4. Incremental Development and Testing: The Agile model supports incremental development, which means that the system's functionality is built incrementally and tested at each iteration. This approach ensures that the developed features are thoroughly tested, reducing the chances of major defects and facilitating early bug detection.

5. Continuous Improvement: Agile methodologies promote continuous improvement through regular retrospectives. The team can reflect on their work, identify areas of improvement, and make necessary adjustments for better efficiency and quality.

Given the dynamic nature of the project, the need for customer collaboration, and the iterative development and testing requirements, the Agile model is well-suited for the development of the online tour reservation system for Citra Tours & Travel Agency.

Functional Requirements:
Tour Reservation: The system should allow registered clients to make tour reservations online. They should be able to browse available tours, select desired tours, specify the number of participants, and provide necessary details such as dates, preferences, and any additional requirements.

Reservation Management: The system should provide administrative functionalities for the clerk to manage tour reservations. The clerk should be able to view, confirm, and process tour reservations made by clients. They should also be able to update reservation statuses, allocate resources (e.g., tour guides, transportation), and handle cancellations or modifications requested by clients.

Communication and Feedback: The system should facilitate communication between clients and the agency. It should provide an email facility for clients to send inquiries, complaints, or suggestions to the manager. The system should ensure that these emails are routed to the appropriate personnel for timely response and resolution.

Non-Functional Requirements:
Usability: The system should have a user-friendly and intuitive interface to ensure easy navigation and efficient usage for both clients and the clerk. It should provide clear instructions, well-organized information, and error-free forms to enhance the user experience.

Security: The system should prioritize data security and confidentiality. It should enforce appropriate access controls, including login credentials for the clerk, to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive client information. The system should also ensure secure transmission of data, particularly during online payment transactions and email communication.
