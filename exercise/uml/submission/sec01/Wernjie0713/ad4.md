### Structured Questions:
1. The user interface component displays patient details, appointment schedules, medical records, billing information, and inventory status to the hospital staff.
2. By enforcing business rules, validating inputs, and orchestrating the flow of data and actions.
3. A data access layer to interact with the database. Retrieving and storing patient-related data, appointments, medical records, billing information, and inventory details.
4. Patient information, appointments, and medical records.
5. Structured data organization, data integrity and consistency, efficient querying and retrieval, data security and access control, scalability and flexibility, data integrity and recovery, and integration and interoperability with other systems.
6. When registering a new patient, the user interface captures patient details and sends them to the backend through a REST API.
7. For appointment scheduling, the user interface displays available slots, and upon selection, sends the appointment details to the backend. The business logic validates the appointment and instructs the data access logic to update the appointment schedule.
8. The business logic coordinates with the data access logic to store and retrieve medical records from the database.
9. It interacts with the data access logic to store billing details and generate invoices.
10. Inventory management involves tracking the availability of medical supplies, equipment, and medications. The business logic updates inventory records based on usage and communicates with the data access logic to ensure accurate inventory management.
