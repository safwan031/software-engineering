## Set: Citra Tours & Travel Agency

**Name: Yong Wern Jie**

**Matrix No: A22EC0121**

**Section: 01**

## Answer
### Question 1:
Agile software development model. It allows for active customer involvement, iterative and incremental development, rapid adaptation to changes, effective collaboration and communication, and early and continuous delivery of working software. These factors are crucial for a system that needs to cater to the needs of both clients and agency users, accommodate changing requirements in the travel industry, and ensure timely delivery of features and improvements.

### Question 2:
Functional Requirements:
- User Registration and Authentication. The system should allow clients to provide their information and register for their own account. The system should also authenticate users during login to ensure the security of their account.
- Tour Reservation Management. The system should provide clients the function of a tour reservation, view information about the tours available, and cancel a previous reservation that they made.
- Email Communication. The system should provide the email facilities that enable the clients to sent any enquiries, complaints or suggestions to the manager of Citra‚Äôs agency.

Non-functional Requirements:
- Performance and Scalability. The system should be capable of handling a large number of concurrent users without significant performance degradation. It should be scalable to accommodate increasing user traffic and provide a responsive user experience even during peak usage periods.
- Security and Privacy. The system should implement robust security measures to protect user data, such as secure storage, encrypted communication, and protection against unauthorized access. It should adhere to privacy regulations and ensure the confidentiality of personal and financial information provided by clients. Additionally, the system should have appropriate measures in place to detect and prevent fraud or unauthorized transactions.
