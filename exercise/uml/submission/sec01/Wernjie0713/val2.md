## Answer
XYZ Healthcare Solutions employs various techniques for software verification. They conduct unit testing, where individual units of the software, such as functions or modules, are tested in isolation to validate their functionality. Integration testing is performed to assess the interaction and compatibility of different software components, ensuring that they work seamlessly together. Additionally, XYZ Healthcare Solutions utilizes code reviews and inspections to detect coding errors, ensure adherence to coding standards, and maintain code quality. XYZ Healthcare Solutions conducts user acceptance testing (UAT) where real users engage with the software to validate its usability, functionality, and performance in real-life scenarios. The feedback gathered during validation activities helps identify any gaps or areas for improvement and ensures that MediCare provides a reliable and user-friendly patient management solution.
