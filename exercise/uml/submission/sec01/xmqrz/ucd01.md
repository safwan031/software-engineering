Use Case: Admit Patient

Primary Actor: Hospital Staff

Preconditions:

The hospital staff has logged into the MSO Hospital Management System.
The staff has access to the patient's information required for admission.
The necessary medical infrastructure and resources are available for admitting the patient.

Main Flow of Events:

1. The hospital staff selects the "Admissions" function in the MSO Hospital Management System.
2. The system presents a form to the staff for entering the patient's admission details.
3. The staff fills in the required information, such as patient's name, contact details, medical history, insurance information, and reason for admission.
4. The staff submits the admission form to the system.
5. The system validates the entered information for completeness and accuracy.
6. If any required information is missing or invalid, the system displays appropriate error messages to the staff, allowing them to correct the errors.
7. Once all the information is validated, the system updates the patient's record in the database with the admission details.
8. The system generates an admission ID or number for the patient, which serves as a unique identifier for their admission.
9. If necessary, the system may also generate and print an admission form or wristband with the patient's details and admission ID.
10. The system notifies the staff about the successful admission process and provides them with the admission details for future reference.

Postconditions:

The patient's admission details are stored in the system's database.
The patient is officially admitted to the hospital and can receive the necessary medical services.
The staff can access the patient's admission information for further treatment, documentation, and billing purposes.

Alternative Flows:

If the system encounters technical issues during the admission process (e.g., server error), it notifies the staff and prompts them to retry or contact technical support.
If the staff realizes they entered incorrect information after submitting the form, they can request to modify the admission details by accessing the patient's record through the system. The system allows authorized staff to update the information and ensures data consistency and integrity.
