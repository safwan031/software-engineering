## Answer
**Question**
1: The most suitable software process model will be Agile method. This is because agile methodology emphasises flexibity, promoting collaboration, and iterative development, which aligns with the dynamic requirements of Citra's travel agency. Agile methodology breaks down the development process into smaller iterations allowing frequenct feedback from stakeholders and allows the development team to quickly make new changes or update new features according to the requirements and needs. Agile allow these changes to be incorporated in subsequent iterations, ensuring a more customer-centric adaptation solution. Besides, it also promotes close collaboration with stakeholders, including clients and end-users. By actively involving them through the cycle, the application can be easily tailored to their wants and needs, providing a more satisfactory solution. Next, agile is possible in delivering a fast, working, and usable product incrementally. This means that the essential features can be developed first in the early iterations and then be deployed earlier, which allow user to start using and benefiting from the system. Only then, the developers can refine the existing features and deploy new versions through each iterations.

2: One of the many functional requirements in the system is user registration and authentication. The system allows new users to create an account by providing necessary personal infomation. It only allows registered users to access into the system. Next, it would be the tour reservation and viewing information about the tours avaialble. The system displays a comprehensive information to the users regarding tours that are available, price, and other related documents. Not only that, there is also the option for users to cancel a previous reservation. If the user felt like there are better deals or any other relevant reasons, as long as the tour date has not reached, they are free to cancel the tour anytime. Another one will be that clients can send any inquiries, complaints and suggestions through the email facilities in the system. In this case, if the client wants has any disagreement, or unsatistified with that the agency is providing, they can freely voice out their opinions. On top of that, there is a reservation management for clerks, They can add, delete, and update the related information on the clients about the tour they registered. They can also confirm and process the tours booked by clients. Lasly, the clerks can send the issued receipt to the client which contains payment information, and tour reservation details. In terms of a non-functional requirement, the system requires performance. The system should be able to handle multiple concurrent users at the same time without significant performance degredation. Besides, the response time for loading the tour information and processing the reservations should be fast and seamless. Another non-functional requirement is security. In order to ensure only the clerk can access Citra's travel agency's database, they are provided special credentials which includes a login ID and password from the manager. This way, the system have proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorised access to senstive data by outside users.

3: Tom Hanks is a client who just got his monthly pay and wishes to make a reservation to have a fun and healing time with a theme of "Beach Gateway" with his family members.
