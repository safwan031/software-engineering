## Answer
1. The most suitable software process model in developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citraâ€™s travel agency is Agile software development model. In the travel industry, clients requirements and market trends can change rapidly. With Agile's flexibility and adaptive nature, the system will be well-suited on accommodating changes and incorporating new features or functionalities as they emerge.

2. #### Functional requirements:
   1.  User Registration and Authentication. The system should have a secure authentication mechanism to verify user identities and ensure data privacy.
   2.  Tour Booking and Management. The system should allow users to manage their bookings, including canceling or modifying reservations.
   3.  Payment Processing. Users should be able to make payments for tour reservations, and the system should provide confirmation and receipts through the users' email.
   #### Non-Functional requirements
   1. Security. The system should employ strong security measures to protect user personal data and financial transactions.
   2. Performance. The system should be able to handle multiple concurrent user requests without any significant delay.
