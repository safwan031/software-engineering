## Answer
1. The most suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency would be the Agile software development model.

   - Flexibility: The Agile model allows for flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process. Given that the requirements of the travel agency may change or evolve over time, Agile's iterative and incremental approach enables the development team to          quickly respond to those changes and incorporate them into the system.
   - Customer Collaboration: Agile emphasizes continuous collaboration with the customer or client. In this case, Citra's travel agency would be actively involved throughout the development process, providing feedback, clarifying requirements, and ensuring that the system meets their needs effectively.
   - Iterative Development: The Agile model breaks the development process into small iterations or sprints. Each iteration delivers a working increment of the system, allowing the travel agency to review and provide feedback on the system's functionality and make any necessary adjustments or additions.
   - Early Delivery of Value: Agile focuses on delivering working software in shorter cycles. This means that the travel agency can start utilizing and benefiting from the system earlier in the development process, allowing for earlier reservations and improved efficiency in managing tour operations.

2. Functional Requirements:

   - User Registration: The system should allow clients to register as users by providing necessary details such as name, contact information, and login credentials.
   - Tour Reservation: The system should provide a user-friendly interface for clients to search for available tours, select desired dates, and make reservations. The system should handle the reservation process, including checking tour availability, capturing payment details, and issuing confirmation receipts.
   - Reservation Management: The system should allow the clerk to view and manage tour reservations made by clients. This includes confirming reservations, updating reservation details if necessary, and generating receipts for clients.

   Non-Functional Requirements:

   - Security: The system should ensure secure transmission and storage of client and reservation information, including implementing appropriate encryption, access controls, and data protection measures.
   - Performance: The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users, providing fast response times and handling peak loads during periods of high demand without significant performance degradation.

3. Pre-conditions:

    - The client has access to the Tours and Travels Reservation System.
    - The client has already registered as a user in the system.
    - The client has identified a tour they wish to reserve.

     Normal Event(s):

    1. The client logs into the Tours and Travels Reservation System using their credentials.
    2. The client navigates to the "Make Reservation" section of the system.
    3. The system presents the client with a search interface to find available tours.
    4. The client enters search criteria such as destination, travel dates, and preferences.
    5. The system retrieves and displays a list of tours that match the client's criteria.
    6. The client selects a specific tour from the list.
    7. The system presents detailed information about the selected tour, including itinerary, pricing, and accommodation details.
    8. The client reviews the tour details and confirms their decision to proceed with the reservation.
    9. The system prompts the client to provide necessary information such as personal details, the number of participants, and any special requests.
    10. The client fills in the required information and proceeds to the payment section.
    11. The system securely handles the payment process, collecting payment details from the client.
    12. The system validates the payment and reservation details.
    13. The system generates a confirmation page or receipt displaying the reservation details, including the tour dates, client information, and payment summary.
    14. The client receives the confirmation and reservation details via email or on-screen display.
    15. The reservation is now successfully made, and the client can proceed with any additional actions or exit the system.

    Abnormal Event(s):

  - If the client's payment is declined, the system notifies the client and provides guidance on alternative payment methods.
  - If there is an unexpected error during the reservation process, such as a system outage or connectivity issue, the system displays an error message and prompts the client to retry or contact customer support.

    Post-conditions:

  - The tour reservation is recorded in the system's database.
  - The client receives a confirmation of the reservation via email or on-screen display.
  - The client can view and manage their reservation through the system if needed.
  - The tour availability is updated, reflecting the reserved spots for the selected tour.
  - The client can proceed with any additional actions within the system or log out.

4. Actors - Client, Clerk, Manager
   Use Cases - Register users, Make Reservations, View tour information, manage reservations, cancel reservation

5. Domain model classes - User, tour, reservation, clerk, manager
