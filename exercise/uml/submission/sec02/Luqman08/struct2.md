## Answer
Use Case: Manage Patient Admissions

Primary Actor: Hospital Staff

Preconditions:
- The Hospital Management System is accessible and functioning properly.
- Hospital staff members have valid login credentials and access privileges.
- Patient information is available and up-to-date in the system.
- The hospital has the necessary medical infrastructure to accommodate new admissions.

Postconditions:
- The patient's admission details are recorded in the system.
- The patient is assigned a unique identifier for tracking purposes.
- The necessary medical resources and facilities are allocated for the patient.
- The patient is provided with appropriate documentation and identification.

Main Flow of Activities:

1. The hospital staff member logs into the Hospital Management System using their authorized credentials.
2. The staff member selects the "Admissions" function from the system's main menu.
3. The system presents the staff member with options for different types of admissions, such as emergency, elective, or transfers.
4. The staff member selects the appropriate type of admission based on the patient's condition.
5. The system prompts the staff member to enter the required patient information, such as name, contact details, medical history, and insurance details.
6. The staff member enters the patient's information accurately into the system.
7. The system validates the entered data and checks for any missing or inconsistent information.
8. If any errors or missing data are detected, the system prompts the staff member to correct or provide the necessary information.
9. Once all the required information is entered and validated, the system generates a unique admission identifier for the patient.
10. The system updates the patient's admission status as "Admitted" and records the admission details, including the assigned ward, bed number, and attending physician.
11. The staff member reviews the recorded information and verifies its accuracy.
12. The system generates and prints necessary admission documents, such as an admission form, consent forms, and identification labels.
13. The staff member provides the printed documents to the patient and ensures they understand the information.
14. The staff member informs the patient about the allocated ward, bed, and the expected waiting time, if applicable.
15. The staff member assists the patient in reaching the designated ward or contacts the relevant hospital personnel for assistance.
16. The system saves all the entered data, updates the patient's record, and makes it available for future reference.

Alternative Flows:

- If the patient's information already exists in the system due to a previous visit or appointment, the staff member can search for the patient's record and update it instead of entering all the information again.
- In case of incomplete or inaccurate patient information, the system may prompt the staff member to contact the patient for additional details or verification.
- If the required medical resources or facilities are not available for the patient's admission, the system may suggest alternatives or prompt the staff member to consult with the hospital administration for further assistance.
- In emergency cases, the system may expedite the admission process by prioritizing the necessary actions and bypassing certain steps.
