Preconditions:
- The hospital staff has logged into the MSO Hospital Management System.
- The staff has the necessary access rights and permissions.
- The patient's information is available in the system.
- The hospital has the required medical infrastructure and resources for admitting the patient.

Main Flow of Activities:
1. The staff selects the "Admissions" function from the system's main menu.

3. The staff fills in the required details of the patient, such as name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history.
4. The staff selects the ward or department to which the patient should be admitted.
5. If the patient is a new admission, the system generates a unique patient ID and assigns it to the patient.
6. The system validates the entered information, checking for any missing or invalid data.
7. If any errors or missing information are found, the system prompts the staff to correct them.
8. Once all the required information is provided and validated, the staff submits the admission request.
9. The system updates the patient's record with the new admission details, including the assigned ward and patient ID.
10. The system notifies the relevant department or ward about the admission, ensuring the necessary preparations are made.
11. The staff informs the patient and provides any additional instructions or information.
12. The system generates an admission confirmation document, including the patient's details, assigned ward, and admission date and time.
13. The staff prints the admission confirmation document and provides it to the patient or their accompanying personnel.
14. The main flow of activities for admitting a patient concludes.

Postconditions:
