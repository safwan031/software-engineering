## Answer

1. The purpose of software verification is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the software to ensure the project done,comply with relevant regulatory requirements.

2. By undergoing user-centric activities. Performing usability testing and user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback from end-users and stakeholders is one of the way that can be done to check if it meets customer expectations and requirements.

3.  Integration testing to validate the interaction between different components of the CRM Pro software.

4.  The activities that can be done to ensure accurancy and completeness are:

- Reviewing the software design, specifications, and coding standards.
- Analyzing the software architecture to ensure it aligns with best practices.
- Checking for compliance with relevant regulatory requirements.
- Conducting code inspections to identify defects, inconsistencies, or code quality issues.
- Utilizing tools for static code analysis to analyze the codebase and identify potential problems or violations.

5.  To validate the functionality of the CRM Pro software through usability testing  such as user experience, interface design and more and user acceptance testing (UAT) such as real-world scenarios simulation.

6.  Testing that can be done to ensure the relibility are:

- Functional testing: Verifies that the software functions as intended and meets the specified requirements.
- Integration testing: Validates the interaction between different components or modules of the software.
- Performance testing: Evaluates the system's responsiveness and performance under different workloads to ensure it meets performance objectives.
- Security testing: Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the software to protect customer data and prevent potential security breaches.

7.   Security of customer data can be protected through security testing such as undergo penetrating testing and implementing robust security measures. Other than that, encrption of user data, access control and more can be done for additional security measure.

8.   Showing that it is easy and efficient for end-users to use the software, ensuring a positive user experience by observing user interaction or usage with the software.

9. XYZ Corporation utilizes static code analysis tools during the verification phase of the CRM Pro software development. These tools analyze the software's source code without executing it and identify potential defects, code quality issues, or violations of coding standards. Static code analysis helps ensure code correctness, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. It provides an automated way to catch common coding errors, such as syntax issues, uninitialized variables, or potential security vulnerabilities.

10.   XYZ Corporation employs performance testing to evaluate the responsiveness of the CRM Pro software under varying workloads. Performance testing involves simulating real-world scenarios and subjecting the software to different levels of user activity or system demands. By measuring response times, resource utilization, and scalability, XYZ Corporation can identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues and optimize the software's performance to ensure it meets performance requirements and user expectations.
