## Answer

XYZ Healthcare Solutions implements software verification techniques by conducting unit testing to validate their functionality. Morevoer, software intergration is conducting integration testing
to access the interaction and compatibility of different software components to ensure all components work great together. This is to identify and eliminate defects, coding erroes and inconsistencies of the software.
In the validation process, the user acceptance testing(UAT) is to ensure all purposes are met and the needs of the end-users and stakeholders are satisfied.  UAT includes the engagements of real users with the software to validate its usability,
functionality and performance in real-life scenarios. All feedback from users is gathered during the validation activities to help identify any gaps or areas for improvements. 
It is also to ensure that MediCare provides a reliable and user-friendly patient management solution.
