## Set: Case Study: Citra Tours & Travel Agency

**Name:Nadhrah NurSabrina Binti Zulaini**

**Matrix No:A22EC0224**

**Section:02**

## Answer
1. The most suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency would be the Agile Methodology. Agile is flexible and iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and
   delivering working software incrementally.
   - Client collaboration : Aagile promotes close collaboration between developers and clients throughut the development process
   - Iterative development : Agile allows for incremental development, where the system is built in small, manageable increments called sprints.
   - Adaptability to change : The travel industry is dynamic, and requirements may change frequently due to customer demands or market trends.
   - Early delivery of value : With Agile , software delivered in short iterations, providing immediate value to the client. This allows Citra's travel agency to start utilizing the online reservation system sooner and gain benefits early in the development process.

2. Functional requirements
   - User Registration : Clients should be able to register an account to access the online reservation system.
   -  Tour Reservation : Clients should be able to browse available tours, select a tour and make a reservation
   -  Reservation Cancellation : Clients should have the ability to cancel a previously made tour reservation.

    Non-Functional Requirements :
   - Security : The system should ensure secure handling of client information, including login credentials and payment details.
   - Performance : The sytem should be able to handle multiple concurrent users and provide a responsiv e and fast user experience.
