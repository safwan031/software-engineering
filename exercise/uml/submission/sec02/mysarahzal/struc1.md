## Question
1. Identify the most suitable software process model in developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra‚Äôs travel agency. Justify and give reasons on your chosen process model.[4 marks]

- Iterative and Incremental Development: The Agile model allows for iterative and incremental development, which is suitable for a dynamic project like an online tour reservation system. The system can evolve through multiple iterations, allowing for frequent feedback and changes based on user requirements.
- Customer Collaboration: The Agile model emphasizes customer collaboration and involvement throughout the development process. Since the system is customer-centric, it is crucial to have continuous interaction with the client to ensure that their needs are met and any changes or updates can be incorporated promptly.
- Flexibility and Adaptability: The Agile model provides flexibility in accommodating changes and adapting to evolving requirements. As the travel industry is subject to constant changes, such as new tour packages or updates in reservation procedures, the Agile model allows for quick adjustments without disrupting the development process.
- Rapid Delivery: The Agile model promotes delivering working software in short iterations, known as sprints. This approach enables the Citra's travel agency to have an early working version of the online reservation system, allowing them to start using and testing it sooner.
2. Elicit THREE (3) Functional requirements and TWO (2) Non-Functional requirements for the proposed online tour reservation system. [10 marks]
#### Functional Requirements:
- User Registration: The system should allow users to register an account with their personal information and login credentials.
- Tour Reservation: Registered users should be able to search for available tours, select a tour, and make a reservation by providing necessary details like date, number of participants, and payment information.
- Reservation Cancellation: Users should have the ability to cancel their tour reservations through the system, and the system should handle the cancellation process and provide appropriate notifications.
#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Security: The system should ensure secure communication and protect sensitive user information, such as personal details and payment information, using encryption and appropriate security measures.
- Performance: The system should be able to handle concurrent user requests and provide a responsive and seamless experience, ensuring quick loading times and minimal downtime.
3. Scenario is a technique used during requirement elicitation activities to analyse real-life example of how a system can be used. Suggest a suitable scenario for the clients to make reservations who wish to travel on tours. [6 marks]

### Scenario: Make a tour reservation
| Column | Description |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Pre-conditions:**         |- The user is registered and logged into the system.|

| **Normal Event(s):**        |- The user selects the desired date, number of participants, and provides payment details. |
|                             |- The system verifies the availability of the selected tour and confirms the reservation. |
|                             |- The system generates a receipt containing payment and tour reservation details. |
|                             |- The receipt is sent to the user's registered email address. |
| **Abnormal Event(s):**      |- The selected tour is no longer available or fully booked.|
|                             |- Payment information provided by the user is invalid.|
|                             |- Technical issues occur during the reservation process. |
| **Post-conditions:**        |- The user receives a confirmation email with the reservation details. |
|                             |- The tour reservation is recorded in the system's database. |

4. Identify suitable actors and FIVE (5) use cases, and then draw a use case diagram for the Tours and Travels Reservation System for Citra Agency. [5 marks]

Actors: Client, Clerk, Manager
  
Use Cases:
  - Register an Account
  - Login to System
  - Make a Tour Reservation
  - Cancel a Tour Reservation
  - Send Enquiries/Complaints/Suggestions
6. Identify FIVE (5) suitable classes for domain model based on the above description for Tours and Travels Reservation System for Citra Agency. [5 marks]
7. Draw a sequence diagram for a Cancel Reservation scenario based on basic flow below: [5 marks]

| **Basic Flow:Cancel Reservation** |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. The scenario starts with the client entering their ID and password to access the reservation system.     |
| 2. The client's information is validated by the system. |
| 3. All reservations made by the client are displayed.    |
| 4. The client chooses which reservation they want to cancel. |
| 5. The cancellation will be updated in the customer information. |
| 6. The updated information will be displayed to the client. |

7. Draw **an activity diagram** for use case of **Reserve a Tour** where it starts with user search for a suitable tour. The system will list all the tour information. If the client wants to book the tour, she/he will enter password and id. The client then proceeds to choose the specific tour and lastly submit the information. The **Reserve a Tour** activity will be ended if the clients do not want to book any tour. [5 marks]
