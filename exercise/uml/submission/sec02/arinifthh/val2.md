  XYZ Healthcare Solutions employs various techniques for software verification.
  They conduct unit testing, where individual units of the software, such as
  functions or modules, are tested in isolation to validate their functionality.
  Integration testing is performed to assess the interaction and compatibility of
  different software components, ensuring that they work seamlessly together.
  Additionally, XYZ Healthcare Solutions utilizes code reviews and inspections to
  detect coding errors, ensure adherence to coding standards, and maintain code
  quality.

- Purpose and significance of user acceptance testing

  The purpose of software validation in the MediCare project is to ensure that the
  software meets the intended purpose and satisfies the needs of the end-users and
  stakeholders. XYZ Healthcare Solutions conducts user acceptance testing (UAT)
  where real users engage with the software to validate its usability,
  functionality, and performance in real-life scenarios. The feedback gathered
  during validation activities helps identify any gaps or areas for improvement
  and ensures that MediCare provides a reliable and user-friendly patient
  management solution.
