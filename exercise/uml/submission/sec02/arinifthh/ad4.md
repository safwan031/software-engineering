###Structured Question
1. Develop a web-based interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface should provide forms and pages for patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, billing, and inventory management. It should communicate with the backend components through REST APIs.
2. Use appropriate design patterns to maintain modularity and scalability.
3. Develop a data access layer to interact with the database. Use an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework like Hibernate or Django ORM to handle database operations. Implement methods to retrieve and store patient-related data, appointments, medical records, billing information, and inventory details.
4. Appointments, medical records, billing information, and inventory details.
5. Using an RDBMS for storing patient information in a Hospital Management System offers advantages such as structured data storage, data integrity, security, efficient querying and reporting, scalability, ACID transactions, data interoperability, and data analytics. These benefits contribute to better data management, improved decision-making, and enhanced patient care in healthcare organizations.
6. When registering a new patient, the user interface captures patient details and sends them to the backend through a REST API.
7. For appointment scheduling, the user interface displays available slots, and upon selection, sends the appointment details to the backend. The business logic validates the appointment and instructs the data access logic to update the appointment schedule.
8.  The business logic coordinates with the data access logic to store and retrieve medical records from the database.
9.  For billing and invoicing, the business logic calculates charges based on treatments, medications, and other services provided. It interacts with the data access logic to store billing details and generate invoices.
10.  Inventory management involves tracking the availability of medical supplies, equipment, and medications. The business logic updates inventory records based on usage and communicates with the data access logic to ensure accurate inventory management.
