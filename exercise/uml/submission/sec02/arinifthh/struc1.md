1. the suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency is the Agile Scrum model.The Agile Scrum model is an iterative and incremental approach that is well-suited for projects with evolving requirements and a need for frequent collaboration and feedback. It consists of short development iterations called sprints, where the development team works on delivering small increments of functionality. 
   
2. Functional Requirements:
   User Registration: The system should allow prospective clients to register and create user accounts.
   This functionality should collect and store necessary information such as name, contact details, and
   login credentials for future access to the system.

   Tour Reservation: The system should provide an interface for registered clients to view available tours,
   select desired tour packages, specify travel dates, and make reservations. It should handle the booking process,
   including checking availability, calculating costs, and generating booking confirmations.

   Reservation Management: The system should enable the clerk to manage the tour reservations made by clients.
   This functionality should allow the clerk to view and process reservations, including confirming bookings,
   updating reservation details, and canceling reservations when required.

   Non-Functional Requirements:
   Security: The system should ensure the security of client and agency data. It should implement appropriate measures such as
   encryption, secure authentication, and access controls to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or data breaches.

   Performance: The system should have efficient performance to handle concurrent user requests and provide a responsive 
   user experience. It should be capable of handling peak loads during high-demand periods without significant slowdowns or downtime, 
   ensuring smooth reservation processes for clients.
