## Answer
## Q1 
The most suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency is the Agile model.
The Agile model promotes iterative and incremental development, allowing for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements. This is beneficial for an online reservation system where requirements may evolve over time.
The Agile model emphasizes collaboration and customer involvement throughout the development process. This aligns with the need for close communication between the development team, clients, and agency staff in order to meet their specific needs and preferences.
The Agile model supports continuous feedback and improvement, which is important for ensuring that the system meets the changing demands of the travel industry and provides an optimal user experience.

## Q2 
3 Functional Requirements for the proposed online tour reservation system:

User Registration: Clients should be able to create an account by providing necessary information such as name, contact details, and email address.

Tour Reservation: Registered clients should be able to select a tour from the available options, specify the desired dates and number of participants, and make a reservation.

Reservation Cancellation: Clients should have the ability to cancel a previously made reservation, which will update the system's records accordingly.

2 Non-Functional Requirements for the proposed online tour reservation system:

Security: The system should ensure secure transmission and storage of user data, including login credentials and personal information, to protect client privacy.
