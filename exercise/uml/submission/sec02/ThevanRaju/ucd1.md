             <br>4. The system displays a form to enter patient details, including personal information, medical history, and insurance details.
             <br>5. The staff enters the required patient information into the form.
             <br>6. The system validates the entered data, checking for completeness and accuracy.
             <br>7. If any errors or missing information are detected, the system prompts the staff to correct them.

             <br>9. The system generates a unique identification number for patient admission.
             <br>10. The staff verifies the generated identification number and confirms the admission process.
             <br>11. The system generates an admission confirmation document containing the patient's details and the assigned identification number.
             <br>12. The staff provides the admission confirmation document to the patient or their representative.
             <br>13. The admission process is completed, and the system returns to the main menu.
