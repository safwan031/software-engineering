## Answer

1. The most suitable software process model is Agile software development model. Agile emphasizes
   interative and incremental development, allowing for frequent feedback and collaboration between
   developers, stakeholders and users, Given the dynamic nature of the travel industry and the need
   for continuous improvement, Agile's iterative approach would enable the development team to quickly
   deliver functional increments of the system while incorporating feedback from clients and stakeholders.

2. Three functional requirements<br>
    a) User registration: Clients should be able to register for an account, providing necessary personal
                           information.<br>
    b) Tour information: The system should display comprehensive information about available tours, including
                           destinations, itineraries, pricing and available dates<br>
    c) Reservation management: Clients should be able to make tour reservations, view their reservations,
                                 and cancel or modify existing reservations.<br>

   Two non-functional requirements<br>
   a) Security: The system should ensure secure handling of client data, including login credentials,
                 personal information, and payment details.<br>
   b) Performance: The system should be capable of handling multiple concurrent users, providing a responsive
                     and seamless reservation experience.<br>
