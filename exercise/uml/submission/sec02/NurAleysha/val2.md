## Answer
- XYZ Healthcare Solutions employs few techniques for software verification. Firstly, they conduct unit testing, where individual units of the software, such as functions or modules, are tested in isolation to validate their functionality.
  Next, they conduct integration testing tp assess the interaction and compatibility of different software components to ensure that they work seamlessly together.
  Lastly, XYZ Healthcare Solutions also utilizes code reviews and inspections to detect coding errors, ensure adherence to coding standards, and maintain code quality.

- The purpose of user acceptance testing in the validation process is to ensure that the software meets the intended purpose and satisfies the needs of the end users and stakeholders.
  Feedback gathered during user acceptance testing helps identify any gaps or areas for improvement and ensures MediCare provides a reliable and user-friendly patient management solution.
