## Answer
1. The most suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency is Agile. This choice is based on three key reasons: Agile's incremental and iterative approach fits the project's complexity, it promotes close customer collaboration, and it accommodates changing requirements effectively.
2. **Functional Requirements:**
User Registration: The system should allow clients to register and create an account, providing necessary information such as name, contact details, and login credentials.
Tour Reservation: The system should provide an interface for clients to search, select, and reserve available tours, specifying the number of participants.
Reservation Management: The system should allow the clerk to view, confirm, update, and cancel tour reservations made by clients.
**Non-Functional Requirements:**
Security: The system should ensure secure transmission and storage of sensitive information, implementing robust authentication and encryption mechanisms.
Performance: The system should have fast response times, handle concurrent user interactions, and be available with minimal downtime to provide a seamless user experience.
3. **Scenario: Mark and Lisa, a couple planning their honeymoon, want to make a reservation for a romantic getaway tour.**
Mark and Lisa visit the Citra Tours & Travel Agency website and explore the "Romantic Getaways" section.
They select the "Tropical Paradise Retreat" tour package, indicating their desired travel dates and the number of participants.
The system displays available options, showcasing luxurious resorts, scenic locations, and activities tailored for couples.
Mark and Lisa compare the options and choose a tour package that offers private beachfront accommodations and couples' spa treatments.
They proceed to the reservation section, where they provide their personal details, such as their names, contact information, and any specific dietary preferences.
After reviewing the reservation summary, Mark and Lisa confirm the reservation and proceed to the secure payment gateway.
The system processes their payment and generates a confirmation email containing the reservation details, including the honeymoon suite details, inclusions, and payment receipt.
Mark and Lisa receive the email, excitedly anticipating their romantic getaway, knowing that their reservation is successfully confirmed.
