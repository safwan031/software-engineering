## Answer
1. The most suitable software process model for developing the proposed online tour reservation system for Citra's travel agency is the Agile model. The Agile model emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development, which aligns well with the requirements of the project.

   #### Justification:

- Flexibility: The Agile model allows for flexibility in accommodating changing requirements throughout the development process. Since the travel industry is dynamic and subject to frequent changes, such as tour availability, pricing, and customer demands, the Agile model can adapt to these changes efficiently.
- Collaboration: The Agile model promotes close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and end-users. In this case, close collaboration between the development team, the travel agency's clerk, and the manager is essential to ensure that the system meets their specific needs and requirements.
- Iterative Development: The Agile model focuses on delivering working software in small increments or iterations. This approach allows the development team to quickly develop and deploy essential features, such as online reservation functionality, tour information, and email communication, and then gather feedback from users to refine and improve the system incrementally.
- Client Involvement: The Agile model encourages active involvement of clients throughout the development process. It aligns well with the requirement for registered clients to access the system, make reservations, view tour information, and provide feedback or suggestions through email facilities. The Agile model ensures that the system evolves based on client input and provides a user-friendly experience.

2. 3 Functional and 2 Non-Functional Requirements
   #### Functional Requirements:

- User Registration: The system should allow prospective clients to register by providing their personal information, including name, contact details, and email address. This information will be used for authentication and communication purposes.

- Tour Reservation: The system should provide an interface for registered clients to browse available tours, select desired tour packages, and make reservations. It should display relevant information about each tour, such as destination, duration, pricing, and availability.

- Reservation Management: The system should enable the agency clerk to manage reservations efficiently. This includes confirming and processing tour reservations made by clients, updating reservation status, and issuing receipts containing payment and tour details.

  #### Non-Functional Requirements:

- Security: The system should ensure secure authentication and data protection. It should employ encryption techniques to safeguard client information, prevent unauthorized access, and protect against data breaches.

- Performance: The system should be responsive and capable of handling concurrent user interactions without significant delays. It should be designed to handle peak loads during periods of high demand, such as holiday seasons or promotional campaigns, without compromising performance.
