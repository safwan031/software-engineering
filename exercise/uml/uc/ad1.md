# Case Study: Hospital Management System

**Actor:** Hospital Staff, Patients

**Purpose:** The Hospital Management System aims to streamline patient admissions, appointments, medical records, and billing processes in MSO Hospital, improving operational efficiency and enhancing the overall patient experience.

**Preconditions:**
- Hospital staff has access to the Hospital Management System.
- Patient information is available in the system.
- The hospital has the necessary medical and billing infrastructure.

**Main Flow:**
1. Hospital staff logs into the Hospital Management System.
2. Staff selects the desired function (e.g., admissions, appointments, medical records, billing).
3. The system presents the corresponding interface for the selected function.
4. Staff performs the necessary actions based on the selected function:
   - Admissions:
     - Enter patient information for admission.
     - Assign a room or bed to the patient.
     - Generate an admission ID.
   - Appointments:
     - Check the availability of doctors.
     - Schedule appointments for patients.
     - Send appointment reminders.
   - Medical Records:
     - Access patient medical records.
     - Update medical history, diagnoses, and treatment plans.
     - Request lab tests and radiology examinations.
   - Billing:
     - Create bills for patients based on services provided.
     - Calculate charges for medications, procedures, and consultations.
     - Process payments and generate invoices.
5. The system validates the entered information and performs necessary checks.
6. If all information is valid, the system updates the corresponding data (e.g., patient records, appointment schedules, billing records).

**Postconditions:**
- Patient admissions, appointments, medical records, and billing information are updated in the system.
- Hospital staff can access updated patient information for future reference.
- Patients receive the necessary medical services and are billed accordingly.

The Hospital Management System allows hospital staff to efficiently manage patient-related processes, ensuring accurate records and improved patient care. It enables staff to perform tasks such as patient admissions, appointment scheduling, medical record management, and billing. The system validates and updates the data to ensure accuracy and completeness. By implementing this system, MSO Hospital aims to enhance operational efficiency, maintain comprehensive patient records, and provide better services to patients.
