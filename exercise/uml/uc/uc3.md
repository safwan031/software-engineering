# Case Study 3: Flight Reservation System

## Description
An airline company is looking to develop a Flight Reservation System to facilitate ticket bookings, seat assignments, and flight schedule management. The aim is to provide a seamless and efficient platform for customers to reserve flights, select preferred seats, and access up-to-date flight schedules. The Flight Reservation System is expected to streamline the booking process, improve customer experience, and optimize flight operations.

In this scenario, a potential traveler visits the airline's website or mobile app to make a flight reservation. The system offers a user-friendly interface where customers can search for available flights by entering their departure and destination cities, along with the desired travel dates. The system retrieves the flight options based on the input and presents the customer with a list of available flights, including departure and arrival times, fares, and the number of available seats.

The customer selects a desired flight from the list and proceeds to make a reservation. The system prompts the customer to provide passenger details such as names, contact information, and any special requirements. The customer enters the required information and proceeds to the seat selection process.

The Flight Reservation System displays an interactive seating layout for the selected flight, allowing the customer to choose their preferred seat. The system provides real-time seat availability information, enabling the customer to make informed decisions. Once the seat selection is complete, the system validates the reservation details and calculates the total fare, including any additional services or fees.

After confirming the reservation, the system generates a unique reservation code and issues an electronic ticket to the customer. The ticket contains essential information such as the flight details, passenger names, seat assignments, and travel dates. Simultaneously, the system updates the flight's seat inventory, ensuring accurate seat management and preventing overbooking.

As the travel date approaches, the Flight Reservation System plays a vital role in managing flight schedules. It provides an interface for airline staff to input and update flight schedules, including departure times, arrival times, and any schedule changes or cancellations. This real-time schedule management ensures that accurate flight information is available to both customers and airline personnel.

Additionally, the Flight Reservation System allows customers to access their reservations and make changes if necessary. Customers can modify their travel dates, update passenger information, or request additional services such as special meals or baggage allowances. The system validates and processes these change requests, keeping the reservation and flight information up to date.

In summary, the Flight Reservation System streamlines the flight reservation process, providing customers with a user-friendly interface to search, select, and book flights. The system also enables customers to choose their preferred seats and access up-to-date flight schedules. By automating seat management, issuing electronic tickets, and facilitating schedule updates, the system enhances the airline's operational efficiency and improves the overall customer experience.
