# Case Study 1: Hospital Management System

## Description
The administrator enters the patient’s name, address, date of birth and emergency contact details into the system. If the patient has only public health insurance, the administrator enters the patient’s medicare number, and the system verifies this with government health database. If the patient also has private health insurance, then the administrator enters also the patient’s private health insurance details, and the system verifies these details with the private health insurance system. When these details are verified as correct, the system saves the patient's details and confirms the registration.

## Question
Based on the case study, create a **use case diagram** that includes essential elements such as use cases, actors, relationships, and other components commonly found in use case diagrams.
